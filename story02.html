The 20th edition of the Index of Economic Freedom shows economic freedom once again on the rise, reaching the highest point in the Index’s 20-year history. Behind this record are stories of human progress and the achievements of countries and their citizens―literally billions of people around the world whose lives have measurably improved. There are also stories of backsliding, regression, and even failure.

As previous editions of the Index have documented, the link between economic freedom and long-term development is clear and strong. Countries that allow their citizens more economic freedom reach higher incomes and better standards of life. People in economically free societies live longer. They have better health. They are able to be better stewards of the environment, and they push forward the frontiers of human achievement in science and technology through greater innovation.

With the perspective of 20 years, it is apparent that despite ups and downs, the principles and lessons of economic freedom have been widely understood, accepted, and implemented in practice by a significant number of countries around the globe. Their progress is seen in the score changes. The poorer performing countries, by contrast, have tried only some of the ideas, adulterated others, or even, in a few cases, rejected them outright.

The negative consequences are readily apparent in countries falling in the rankings. The Index provides compelling evidence that economic prosperity and economic freedom go hand in hand. Lasting prosperity cannot exist in the absence of economic freedom.

To be sure, there have been setbacks for economic freedom over the past two decades. (See Chart 1.) Some of them were quite severe as in the aftermaths of the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial turmoil. 
Looking back, however, the crises have served as critical tests of countries’ commitments to preserving and advancing economic freedom. The political and policy choices that emerged from the crises and in subsequent years have led to diverging trends of economic freedom with far-reaching economic consequences for those who have chosen different paths. Countries that have acknowledged the limits of government and continued their commitment to sustaining economic freedom have reaped tangible rewards of swift economic rebound and renewed dynamism. By contrast, those that have relinquished economic freedom with short-sighted interventionist and populist policies have prolonged the crises and fallen into the trap of economic stagnation and greater uncertainty.

These real examples of the consequences of the rise and fall of economic freedom in countries around the globe demonstrate unmistakably that economic prosperity is not a national birthright: Rich economies can fall into self-inflicted stagnation all too quickly, while long-suffering underdeveloped nations can ascend from poverty to economic dynamism in a matter of years.

As the Index has documented over the past two decades, the most critical variable in sustaining the wealth of nations and the most effective means to eliminating poverty is economic freedom.

The findings of the 2014 Index once again evince the strongly positive link between advancing economic freedom and achieving greater prosperity. Chart 2 shows the most basic benefit of economic freedom, confirmed now with data covering 20 years: the strong relationship between economic freedom and levels of per capita income. For countries that achieve scores that reflect even moderate levels of economic freedom (60 or above), the relationship between economic freedom and per capita GDP is highly significant.

Greater levels of economic freedom have had a major positive impact on poverty levels over the past decade. Poverty intensity, as measured by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Multidimensional Poverty Index that assesses the nature and intensity of deprivation at the individual level in education, health, and standard of living, is much lower on average in countries with higher levels of economic freedom. The intensity of poverty in countries whose economies are considered mostly free or moderately free is only about one-fourth the level in countries that are rated less free.

Twenty Years of Advancing Economic Freedom

By a great many measures, the past 20 years during which the Index has been charting the advance of economic freedom have been the most prosperous in the history of humankind. More people are living better lives than ever before. Some, unfortunately, are not. As Index editor Terry Miller pointed out in these pages in 2009, it is a human tragedy―an appalling, avoidable human tragedy―that not all of the world’s people have participated in our era’s explosion of prosperity.1


<a href= "pic13.html">Economic Freedom & Poverty</a><br><br>
Since 1995, when the Index started documenting economic policies that promote broader economic growth and greater well-being, we have learned that:2
--Those countries that practice some version of free-market capitalism, with economies open to global trade and investment, do better than those that are protectionist or that shun economic linkages with others.
--Competition promotes greater productivity and a more efficient allocation of resources than central planning.
--Private ownership and the protection of individuals and enterprises by the rule of law encourage effort and initiative more than do collectivism and socialism.
--Governments that dominate their countries’ economies impoverish their citizens through economic stagnation.

The free-market system that is rooted in economic freedom has fueled unprecedented economic growth around the world. As Chart 3 illustrates, over the past two decades in which the global economy has moved toward greater economic freedom, becoming “moderately free” overall, the world economy achieved real GDP expansion by around 70 percent, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.

<a href= "pic14.html">Relations: Economic Freedom & Poverty</a><br><br>
With global economic freedom rising over the past two decades, the world has recorded significant economic growth, and the global poverty rate has been cut in half. Opening the gates of prosperity to ever more people around the world, economic freedom has made the world a profoundly better place.

	<b><a name="T2">The Importance of Growing Economic Freedom</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Any discussion about advancing economic freedom is essentially a story of the empowerment of people. Strengthening and expanding freedom improves each individual’s chance to achieve his or her goals and own and enjoy the value of what he or she creates. Amartya Sen, a Nobel laureate economist who has made considerable contributions to development economics, once noted that “[d]evelopment consists of the removal of various types of unfreedoms that leave people with little choice and little opportunity for exercising their reasoned agency.”3 People crave liberation from poverty, and they hunger for the dignity of free will. By reducing barriers to these fundamentals, the forces of economic freedom create a framework in which people can fulfill their dreams of success.

In this vein, one of the most important goals of economic policy in almost every country in the world is to increase the rate of economic growth. Since the Index of Economic Freedom is primarily a measure of the economic policy environment in various countries, the 20-year history of the Index and its database have a lot to say about what really drives economic growth and related human progress in different aspects. There is strong support within the global database for the idea that improvements in economic freedom are an important determinant of rates of growth. Key drivers of this economic growth and poverty reduction are the high levels of flexibility and resilience that come with economic freedom.

More specifically, as documented in the previous editions of the Index and supported by volumes of academic research, vibrant and lasting economic growth results when governments implement policies that enhance economic freedom and empower individuals with greater choice and more opportunities. In fact, the advancement of economic freedom is the most straightforward path to dynamic growth and true progress for the greatest number of people.

As Chart 4 demonstrates, there is a robust relationship between improving economic freedom and achieving higher per capita economic growth. Whether long-term (20 years), medium-term (10 years), or short-term (5 years), the relationship between changes in economic freedom and changes in economic growth is consistently positive.

Undeniably, countries moving toward greater economic freedom tend to achieve higher rates of growth in per capita GDP over time. In all of the three specific periods examined in this 20-year Index database, the average annual per capita economic growth rates of countries that have grown economic freedom most are at least 50 percent higher than those of countries where freedom has stagnated or eroded.
<a href= "pic15.html">Economic Freedom & Growth</a><br><br>
Even better, advancing economic freedom produces dynamic and inclusive growth for ordinary people in a society. Economic freedom, cultivated by the rule of law, limited government, regulatory efficiency, and open markets, has proven to be critical to generating the broader-based economic growth that creates opportunities in all sectors of society.

	<b><a name="T3">Economic Freedom: The Real Agent of Revolution</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
As emphasized in the Index and confirmed by its findings, sustaining vibrant growth and broader-based economic expansion requires that countries be committed to putting into practice three fundamental principles of economic freedom: empowerment of the individual, non-discrimination, and open competition.

In pursuing these principles of economic freedom and the policies necessary to realize them over the past 20 years, many governments have facilitated the free flow of goods and services, improved the ease of doing business, established monetary stability, and cut taxes, all while accentuating greater transparency and accountability under more dependable rule of law.

It is encouraging to see that the powerful forces of economic freedom have fostered the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that creates new products and more jobs, spreading the benefits of economic dynamism to an increasing number of countries around the globe over the past 20 years. As Chart 5 summarizes, more countries are classified as at least “moderately free,” with scores of above 60, today than in the 1995 Index.

The advancement of global economic freedom to its highest level ever in the 2014 Index, with a greater number of countries rated at least “moderately free,” is particularly welcome given that the notable upsurge has been driven mainly by developing and emerging economies around the world, which now account for the first time in the modern era for about half of the global economy’s output.4
<a href= "pic16.html">Countries in Category</a><br><br>
Globally, 124 countries have improved their economic freedom scores relative to the first year in which they were rated in the Index, while 52 countries have recorded score declines.

Most notably, 10 developing countries across the globe that were rated as “repressed” economies in the first years they were graded in the Index almost 20 years ago have successfully leaped forward into the ranks of the “moderately free” or “mostly free.” (See Chart 6.)

This is quite a geographically and economically diverse group, encompassing African countries, Eastern European countries, and members of the former Soviet Union. Over the past two decades, these 10 developing economies as a group have recorded an average annual economic growth rate of 5 percent, which is 1.2 percentage points higher than the average of all other countries.

On the other end of the scale, three countries―Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela―have dropped into the ranks of the “repressed” over the past two decades. (See Chart 6.) These economies were rated more highly in the first years they were graded in the Index but since then have steadily lost economic freedom. These three have recorded growth rates that, on average, lag almost two percentage points behind those that have graduated from “repressed” status.

	<hr><br>
	
Growing economic freedom is unequivocally about achieving greater overall prosperity that goes beyond materialistic and monetary dimensions of well-being. Improvements in economic freedom enhance economic dynamism and, thus, overall human developmental progress.

Advancing economic freedom is strongly related to the enhancement of overall human development as measured by the UNDP Human Development Index, a composite assessment of health, education, and standard of living. As Chart 7 shows, since the beginning of this century, countries that have improved their economic freedom to greater degrees have also achieved much greater enhancement of human development.
Governments that choose policies that increase economic freedom are placing their societies on the pathway to more education opportunities, better health care, and greater standards of living for their citizens. Those governments in the first quartile that have embraced policies that enhance economic freedom have recorded at least a 30 percent higher average annual growth rate of overall human development since 2000 in comparison to the others.

Greater economic freedom can also provide more fertile ground for effective and democratic governance. Advancing economic freedom is about empowering more people to exercise greater control of their daily decision-making processes. In doing so, economic freedom ultimately nurtures political reform as well. Economic freedom encourages a pluralistic society and makes it possible for independent sources of ideas and resources to counterbalance entrenched political power.
Debate about the direction of causality between economic freedom and democracy has become more controversial in recent years due to the multifaceted interaction between the two. However, the positive relationship that exists between economic freedom and political freedom is undeniable. Chart 8 demonstrates that there is a positive linkage between advancing economic freedom and greater political freedom as measured by Freedom House. Although the relationship is not as robust as one might hope to see, over the past two decades, countries that have advanced their economic freedom have tended to achieve greater enhancement of political freedom in general.

Undoubtedly, achieving greater political freedom and well-functioning democracy is a messy and often excruciating process. However, the complex interplay between improving economic freedom and advancing political freedom is something positive and merits further examination.

Improving and maintaining economic freedom is the proven way to generate positive cycles of economic growth and lasting prosperity. Economies that have advanced economic freedom have achieved overall levels of growth higher than those achieved by countries where economic freedoms have been curtailed by the heavy hand of government. No other systems that have been tried have come close in terms of providing broad-based prosperity. Countries that have not joined the march of freedom have left their citizens lagging behind and even, in the worst cases, stuck in poverty or destitution.

Such failures are inexcusable. Most important, they are preventable. It is too soon to know how coming years will play out as the Index of Economic Freedom enters its third decade. Nonetheless, it is both heartening to know that economic freedom is again on the march and safe to predict that countries that find the political will and wisdom to advance economic freedom will see their citizens prosper in the years ahead.

	<b><a name="T6">The Moral Case for Economic Liberty</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
John Tomasi, PhD

Readers of the Index of Economic Freedom are familiar with the political and material case for economic liberty. There is a robust positive correlation between the protection of economic freedom and the achievement of such important goals as material prosperity and political liberty. As the authors of the 2013 Index summarized that year’s findings, “Countries with higher levels of economic freedom substantially outperform others in economic growth, per capita incomes, health care, education, protection of the environment, and reduction of poverty….”1 This can be called the institutional case for economic freedom.

However, if we believe it is important that people everywhere enjoy goods such as decent health care, a clean environment, and rising per capita wages, then, in drawing attention to the link between economic freedom and the production of these political and material values―that is, in making the institutional case for economic liberty―we are, ipso facto, also making a moral case for economic freedom. We should defend economic liberty not only because such liberties have a proven record of securing political and material benefits, vitally important as those goods may be. By protecting economic liberty, there is also a sense in which we respect other people as our moral equals. In particular, when we insist that governments protect private economic liberty, we insist that those governments respect their citizens as responsible authors of their own lives.

When people are free, they think of themselves as in some sense the central causes of the particular lives they are leading. It is not just captains of industry or heroes of Ayn Rand novels who define themselves through their accomplishments in the economic realm. Many ordinary people―middle-class parents, single mothers, entry-level workers, small-scale entrepreneurs in the developing world―become who they are and express who they hope to be by the personal choices they make regarding work, saving, and spending. These are areas in which people earn esteem from others and feel a proper pride for things they themselves do.

To fully understand the moral importance of economic liberty, we may need to widen the lens through which we view the world. In economic affairs, after all, it is not only the outcome that matters: The process must be considered too. Possessing some particular bundle of material goods, from this perspective, becomes more meaningful if one possesses that bundle because of one’s own actions and choices. Diminishing personal agency in economic affairs―no matter how lofty the social goal―may drain vital blood from a person’s life. When private economic freedoms are curtailed, people become in some important sense less free.

	<b><a name="T7">Making the Personal Case for Economic Liberty</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
None of this is to diminish the importance of the institutional case for economic freedom: Economic liberties are linked to other basic rights and liberties, promote the creation of social wealth, reduce government corruption, and mitigate the dangers of concentrated political power. But in addition to this, individuals everywhere have a moral right to be respected as causes―or, as I prefer, as responsible authors―of their own lives. Thus, the personal case for private economic liberty is worth making too.

The Index of Economic Freedom sets out and measures 10 separate areas of economic freedom, a comprehensive scheme that attends to important institutional dimensions of economic liberty. To make the personal case for economic liberty, we need to cut up the conceptual space a bit differently by focusing on the first-person aspects of economic freedom.

James Nickel, a prominent philosopher of human rights, distinguishes four (partially overlapping) categories of economic liberty, all of which protect autonomy of action in economic affairs. Nickel’s four categories are liberties of labor, transacting, holding, and using.2
--Regarding the economic liberty of labor, Nickel says: “This is the liberty to employ one’s body and time in productive activity that one has chosen or accepted, and under arrangements that one has chosen or accepted.”
--The liberty of transacting allows individuals to engage in free economic activity. “This is the freedom to manage one’s economic affairs at the individual and household levels and on larger scales as well.” Transacting involves the liberty to trade in the marketplace, to create things for sale, and to save and invest. It also covers the freedom of individuals and groups to start, run, and close down businesses such as factories, shops, farms, and commercial enterprises of many sorts.
--The economic liberty of holding concerns freedom in the realm of private property. “This category covers legitimate ways of acquiring and holding productive property, using and developing property for commercial and productive purposes, and property transactions such as investing, buying, selling, trading and giving.”
--Finally, there is a range of liberties concerning using. “This is the liberty to make use of legitimately acquired resources for consumption and production.” The liberty of using protects the freedom of citizens to buy, use, and consume natural resources, consumer goods, and services. On the commercial level, this liberty protects production-related consumption (such as deciding which parts to use or which power sources to purchase). On the domestic level, it protects a range of personal economic decision making, including questions about what to eat and drink, what to wear, what type of housing to have, and a wide range of services one might choose to purchase.

To simplify, I will refer to these first-person economic liberties as the liberties of working and owning.

Most legal systems include some degree of protection for each of these categories of economic liberty. However, systems differ dramatically in the way they specify the activities that are to be protected in each category. Significantly, systems also differ with respect to the degree of importance they assign to such protections when they conflict with other social goals and values.3

	<b><a name="T8">The Classical Liberal Framework</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
I will be setting out the personal case for economic liberty within a classical liberal framework. This is the framework pioneered by radical English thinkers such as John Lilburne and John Locke, developed in the American context by Founders such as James Madison, and defended in our day by legal scholars such as Richard Epstein.

Classical liberals affirm what we might call a thick conception of economic liberty. They tend to interpret each category of private economic liberty as having a wide scope. Regarding the liberties of holding (or “owning”), for example, classical liberals affirm not only the right to ownership of personal property (as guaranteed even by most socialist systems), but rights to the private ownership of productive property as well. People should be free to start small businesses, to join in large capital ventures with others, and generally to establish economic entities of a great variety of kinds (including, if they wish, worker-directed cooperatives).

Closely connected, classical liberals typically interpret the economic liberty of labor to include a wide freedom of individuals to negotiate personally the terms of their employment (including both wage rates and number of hours to be worked). Classical liberals interpret the economic liberty of transacting to include the right of individuals to decide for themselves how much to save for retirement, to decide how much to invest in health care, and to make decisions about many other issues of long-term financial planning.

Further, classical liberals see these wide-ranging economic liberties as being especially weighty compared to other social values. They see economic liberties as having a political status comparable to that of the other traditional liberal rights and liberties, such as liberties of speech and association. But classical liberals do not treat economic liberties as moral absolutes or as in any way more basic than the other fundamental rights and liberties. While important, such liberties do not trump every other social concern.

This last feature distinguishes classical liberalism from a closely related but importantly distinct tradition that we might call libertarianism. By libertarians, I am thinking of historical figures such as Lysander Spooner and more recent writers such as Murray Rothbard, Robert Nozick, and Ayn Rand.4 Classical liberals and libertarians share an appreciation for the great institutional and personal importance of private economic liberty, but while classical liberals see economic liberties as being among the weightiest rights, libertarians tend to see property rights as the weightiest rights of all and even as moral absolutes.

Thus, unlike the libertarians, classical liberals accept that even the weightiest economic liberties can sometimes be curtailed or regulated to preserve other foundational liberties and sometimes to allow the pursuit of other important social purposes as well. For example, classical liberals would not think the state should enforce contracts that alienate citizens from their other basic rights and liberties (for example, an economic contract that required a person to engage in some form of religious devotion or to enter into slavery). Second, classical liberals traditionally grant that governments have some (albeit carefully limited) powers of eminent domain. They also recognize that governments have the power to act to maintain free and competitive markets (for example, by regulating or breaking up monopolies of scarce resources or by forbidding various forms of collusion and price fixing).

My thesis is that liberties of working and owning, interpreted within a wider classical liberal framework, have great personal moral value. While this might not surprise regular readers of the Index of Economic Freedom, it is of the utmost importance to understand how controversial this idea is and that it is controversial not just within moribund pockets of Marxists and socialists, but also across wide swaths of people living in (and voting in) the contemporary liberal democracies of the West.

Far from being a lofty ideal, the idea of living in a world in which there exist big and growing businesses, where workers typically negotiate the terms of their own employment, and where individuals are largely responsible for saving for their own retirement or for making their own arrangements for medical care is seen by many people as living in a world of injustice, exploitation, and vulnerability that can be corrected only by an extensive system of governmental regulations and the erection of expansive tax-funded social service programs. Thus, many people reject the personal case for economic liberty.

Further, many of our fellow citizens also reject the personal case for economic liberty on what they believe to be moral grounds. If a world of personal economic liberty is said to be unjust and exploitative, then many people will rally against those liberties when they hear the moral call. To understand this perspective and how powerfully it shapes the view of many people within Western democracies, it is important to examine its historical roots.

	<b><a name="T9">Critics of Economic Liberty: Mill, Keynes, and Rawls</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
John Stuart Mill, writing in the mid-1800s, was one of the first thinkers in the liberal tradition to raise doubts about the moral importance of economic liberty. Earlier classical liberals, such as James Madison and Benjamin Constant, had seen economic liberty as fully on a par with the civil and political rights of individuals: the right to a fair trial, freedom of expression, political participation, personal autonomy, and so on. But when Mill surveyed the traditional list of liberal liberties, he singled out the economic liberties for relegation to a distinctly secondary place.

Mill’s official argument for treating the economic liberties in this exceptional way is based on his distinction between two spheres of human activity. In the sphere of liberty are activities that primarily concern only the individual or, if they involve other people, do so only with their free consent and participation. Mill saw this as the sphere of individual liberty.5

The other sphere, that of coercion, concerns activities that directly affect other people. Because society has a direct interest in the activities within this sphere, the state may properly exercise coercion there to promote the common good. While Mill sees freedoms of speech and assembly, conscience and religion, and other activities that are central to becoming the author of one’s own life as self-regarding activities (that is, as aspects of liberty), he insists that economic activities―seeking a job, deciding whether to save or spend the income one earns―are other-regarding and thus not aspects of liberty properly understood. In Mill’s succinct formulation, “trade is a social act.”6 Thus, trade is a domain subject to social control and regulation rather than being a domain of protected liberty.

This is a surprisingly weak argument from a philosopher of Mill’s caliber. After all, speech and assembly are acts that affect others, and in that sense, they appear to be just as “social” as trade.7 So it seems we must look deeper to understand why Mill denigrates the personal importance of economic liberty in this way.

Mill’s moral and political philosophy rests ultimately on a perfectionist ideal of the person. Mill sees individuality as capturing something close to the moral essence of personhood. While a self-proclaimed utilitarian, Mill emphasizes that he means “utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.”8 Chief among those interests is that of developing a life plan to suit one’s character. By creating such a plan, people express their distinctive sense of what is valuable and worth doing in life. By developing and pursuing such a plan, people develop their higher capacities of reasoning, develop intimate connections with others, and enhance their moral sensitivities. Mill saw intellectual pursuits as central to a well-lived life, but he famously claimed to be open to experimentation and readily acknowledged that there might be a wide range of activities and life plans that people can use to develop themselves as individuals.

However, perhaps surveying the scene from his position of social privilege, Mill did not see how activities in the economic sphere could contribute to individuality in his sense. Freedoms of thought and association are important to forming and carrying out a life worthy of a progressive being, but Mill does not see economic liberties―the freedom to hold productive property or to enter into economic contracts―as playing any central role in this process. Starting a business, holding a job, seeking a promotion, being a breadwinner for one’s family, saving for the future―these are roles that economic necessity may require people to play from time to time, but none of these activities is constitutive of liberty.

Economic life provides barren soil for the development of individuality. Progressive beings do not need economic liberty to “pursue their own good their own way.” For Mill, economic liberties are instrumentally valuable: “property is only a means to an end, not itself the end.”9

Mill is not the only hero of the Left to argue against the personal importance of economic liberty. In 1930, John Maynard Keynes wrote a remarkable essay, “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren.”10 Writing at a time of economic despair, Keynes expressed long-term optimism: Within one hundred years, during the lifetimes of his own grandchildren, the economies of Western democracies such as the United States and the United Kingdom would have grown approximately tenfold. At that point, roughly in 2030, Western economies would have grown enough. The economic problem, the problem of scarcity that has bedeviled mankind since our appearance on this planet, would at last have been solved. That is, we would have reached a point of sufficient wealth so that increases in capital accumulation could―and Keynes says should―cease. When this not-too-distant day of prosperity dawned, Keynes suggested, a great moral change could at last be welcomed across our social world.

What would change when the economic problem is solved? Keynes says that, finally, the busy, industrious, purposive, economic “bourgeois virtues”―taking risks and toiling, scrimping today in order to save for tomorrow, striving and sacrificing so that the lives of one’s children might be better than one’s own―might at last be recognized as the ugly vices that they have always been. We needed those deluded “virtues” to get us to the stage of sufficient wealth, but once wealth arrives, the central human problem will not be how to work better. Rather, our great problem will be how best to spend the leisure time that the toils of our parents, grandparents, and great-great-grandparents have bought us.

Keynes suggests that, for the first time in human history, life will not center on economic problems at all. Instead, life will center at last on the only properly human question: how, amid the abundance of wealth, “to live, wisely, agreeably, and well.” And what about those who continue to show personal concern for economic questions, clinging to the traditional values of hard work and industry, self-reliance and personal responsibility? In these new conditions, Keynes says that such attitudes are not virtues but “morbid neuroses.” People who exhibit them, Keynes suggests (perhaps jokingly?), should be confined to mental institutions.

Similarly, though less colorfully, John Rawls, writing in 1971, produced a great manifesto of social justice. Rawls offers a machinery that is designed to identify a strong set of distributive principles of justice, constrained only by a short list of basic rights and liberties that limit the reach and power of government. Rawls’s spare list of basic rights includes protections in such familiar areas of human freedom as association and speech. However, following in the tradition of Mill and Keynes, Rawls makes no special place for the economic liberties of capitalism. Indeed, on his account, the requirements of liberal justice could be satisfied in what he calls a “democratic socialist” regime: that is, a regime that limited economic liberty even to the point of denying the private ownership of productive property.

What We Value and Who We Are

With all respect, I disagree with this tradition of thinking. Economic liberties are valuable not only because of their well-documented institutional and material advantages (for example, because the protection of economic liberty is positively correlated with lower levels of corruption and with increases in per capita income). Though Lord Keynes may have looked down his long nose on the familiar work-a-day virtues associated with the economic liberties, for many ordinary working people, the development and exercise of these virtues in support of one’s own dreams and the dreams one has for loved ones comes close to the core of life.

When we make decisions about how much we are willing to work, at what wages, and in which business sector or profession, just as when we make decisions about whether to spend now or save for later, we are not engaged in activities that are morally trivial. Instead, through our activities in these economic aspects of our lives, each of us says something important about what we value and, indeed, about who we are. Decisions about saving and spending, for example, are among the most common of economic quandaries, and these questions regularly confront people in free societies regardless of their income level. Those questions, distinctively, require that each of us think carefully about the relationship between the person we are now and the person we will become in the future.

Temporal thinking of that sort is closely connected to the process of becoming an adult. Such decisions are among the most distinctive forms of taking responsibility for one’s own life and doing so in light of one’s own dreams, values, and character. Economic choices about spending and saving, as with other economic decisions, such as setting oneself on one course of study or on one career path rather than another, constitute a kind of passageway from childhood or late adolescence toward full adulthood. Citizens who are denied the chance to make such choices for themselves or whose range of decision-making in these areas is truncated by others (no matter how well meaning) will live comparatively stunted lives, lives that are in some sense less fully adult.

Intriguingly, a similar assertion about the personal importance of economic liberty was made by leaders of the feminist movement during the 19th century. Early feminist leaders such as Voltairine De Cleyre argued against patriarchy in a way that put the personal importance of economic liberty front and center. No matter how “gilded” the social cage that men of that era had constructed for women, no matter how abundant the material goods made available within that cage or how tender the treatment, feminist leaders of that era, denied their economic liberties, denied the chance to have some role in the creation and selection of whatever goods they were to enjoy, insisted that a great moral wrong was being done to them.11

By denying women their economic liberties, men had prevented them from fully developing as free and independent adults―as moral equals, each one in charge of her own life. No amount of pointing to the comforts that they were being provided by their male protectors could make up for this fact. Denied full economic liberty, women of the era had been fundamentally disrespected: Their moral agency, their capacity for responsible self-authorship, had been stunted and denied.

That early feminist defense of economic liberty might well be turned against the material ambitions of some contemporary social democracies. Here again, no matter how gilded the cage of a social democracy may seem, no matter how comfortable and plentiful the social guarantees, if the cost of receiving those benefits is the violation or truncation of personal economic liberty, then there is something objectionable about this scheme. This is a world, whatever its material bounty, with great moral loss. That loss is what I mean by the personal value of economic liberty.

	<b><a name="T10">Breaking Free of Old Dichotomies</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Perhaps the most alarming finding in recent editions of the Index of Economic Freedom has been the sharp decline in economic liberty in the United States, once a beacon of economic liberty. I believe that the personal case for economic liberty has been presented too weakly in recent years. That moral ideal has dimmed and no longer burns brightly in the mind of every citizen. Part of the reason may be that in some countries, citizens recently have become willing to heed the siren call of politicians offering ever more government services and goods in exchange for citizens giving up ever more personal economic liberty. Often, those offers of governmental services are presented as required by morality itself―say, under the banner of fairness or social justice. Thus, within contemporary political discourse, we find the personal case for economic liberty pitted against another set of powerful moral ideas: the idea of material justice.

And so citizens today face a set of political choices that are equally stark and unhappy: democracy or capitalism, economic liberty or material justice, free markets or fairness. One side or the other, everyone has to choose. No wonder our societies have become so divided and the political rhetoric so extreme.

Thankfully, one of the most exciting developments in recent political and economic thinking has been an attempt to break free from those old dichotomies.12 And here again, the Index of Economic Freedom has an important role to play.

One way to break the ideological deadlock might be to hold tight to both the personal and institutional cases for economic liberty but to present the institutional case in a way that emphasizes economic liberty’s benefits for all classes of citizens and most especially for ordinary working people, including workers at the very bottom of the existing pay scale. If we consistently find a positive correlation between economic liberty and important social goods such as economic growth and rising per capita income, the program of economic liberty might itself be defended on grounds of material justice and fairness too. If that message can be communicated to our fellow citizens, then a democratic case for economic liberty might be forged once again, thus better securing those liberties about which in recent years there has been so much doubt.

If we attend to the full Index of economic liberties, their personal value as well as their capacity to create wealth that might be enjoyed by all, we may find ourselves living in a world of both social abundance and personal freedom: democracy and capitalism, economic liberty and material justice, free markets and fairness. By making this fuller case for economic liberty, perhaps people do not have to choose after all.

	<b><a name="T11">Antidote to Poverty: Economic Freedom, Not Government Dependency</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Sergio Daga

In 1979, Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman stated, “no economic system in history has been as successful at lifting people out of poverty as that of capitalism and free trade, based on principles of economic freedom.” He also remarked, “there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lots of ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system.”1

Economic freedom has done more for the poor throughout the world than any taxpayer-funded social program or welfare check ever could. This system based on individual freedom, private property, limited government, and limited regulation has improved the lives of millions of people worldwide. Every year, the results of The Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom reinforce the conclusion that the world’s freest economies have less human poverty and higher living standards.

Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence of success over the past two centuries, however, critics continue to insist that economic freedom has been a failure. A frequent charge is that governments that prioritize policies such as low tax rates, impartial rule of law, strong private property rights, and unfettered access to markets generally fail to provide citizens with adequate social benefits such as health care and education―key components of the multidimensional measures of poverty. The results of the Index of Economic Freedom tell a quite different story. In fact, greater economic freedom correlates with better outcomes in education and health.2

Attempts to improve people’s quality of life have been particularly important in emerging and less developed economies because of their relatively higher poverty rates. In fact, while the poverty headcount rate in most developed countries is close to zero according to the international measure of USD2 a day (in PPP),3 in the rest of the world, poverty affects the lives of billions.4 It is logical and understandable that governments in these economies and the international aid community worry about this problem and occasionally make new plans and programs to eradicate poverty. The Millennium Development Goals, promising to cut poverty in half by 2015, are one example.5

The idea of cash transfers to the poor, a form of social assistance programs that emerged in the mid-1990s, has recently captured increased attention from policymakers and scholars due to the increasing number of countries that have been adopting such programs.6 Today, these types of programs are the most common social assistance interventions in many emerging and less-developed economies, especially in Latin America, and more recently in Africa and Asia.

Cash transfers are increasingly popular both within the donor community and among policymakers in developing countries that are seeking more innovative ways to improve welfare. The idea behind cash transfer programs is that distributing cash to the poor seems more efficient than public-sector spending.

There are different variations of cash transfers, but they can be grouped into two types: conditional or unconditional. Although unconditional cash transfers, such as pensions to the elderly, are still in force and represent a significant amount of money in public budgets, the introduction of conditionality on cash transfers has become more popular among governments because of the political benefits that can accrue to the ruling party or the central government. Adding requirements that the poor “do something” might be necessary in helping to make cash transfers politically acceptable even while having little to do with the eventual success or failure of the program in meeting its goals.7

Moreover, studies of cash transfers in developing countries have concluded that the determining factor for beneficiaries in executing the pre-specified actions was the increase in income, not the conditionality, which had no discernable impact. Thus, the conditions attached to such programs and the additional cost of enforcing them may be less valuable than the cash itself.8

Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs aim to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by conditioning payments on compliance with co-responsibilities intended to develop children’s human capital. By introducing these programs, proponents expect that conditions would allow the accumulation of sufficient human capital to drive the next generation out of poverty so that social assistance would no longer be needed in the future.9

All of the above seem noble intentions, but there is little evidence that such programs have resulted in improvements in the quality of life of poor families. Public services in most of the developing world still lack quality, mainly because governments generally insist on maintaining a monopoly on the service in question and are reluctant to accept private competition. Additionally, these types of programs have not helped the poor to get permanent jobs because their labor skills and productivity remain unchanged. Moreover, year after year, the coverage of these programs increases along with the amount of money needed to keep them running, and there is strong evidence that due to poor monitoring and control mechanisms, these programs are creating clientelistic behavior on the part of politicians.

Sadly, many of the countries that have introduced cash transfer programs have not made any improvements in advancing economic freedom. Structural policy changes that foster rule of law, limited government, regulatory efficiency, and open markets―key elements of economic freedom―are needed to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Delays in the implementation of such policies are typically the main reason why some countries fail to eradicate poverty or provide higher living standards for their inhabitants.

	<b><a name="T12">CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMS</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
One of the main arguments by the proponents of cash transfer programs is advanced by Ariel Fiszbein and Norbert Schady: 


Although market-driven economic growth is likely to be the main driver of poverty reduction in most countries, markets cannot do it alone. Public policy plays a central role in providing the institutional foundations within which markets operate, in providing public goods, and in correcting market failures. In addition to laying the foundations for economic growth, policy can supplement the effects of growth on poverty reduction, and one of the instruments that governments can use to that end is direct redistribution of resources to poor households.10

Under this premise, CCT programs have received significant and increasing attention. Many countries in the developing world have created programs that make regular payments to poor households on the condition that those households undertake pre-specified actions such as periodic health and nutrition checkups, growth monitoring, and vaccinations for children younger than five years of age. Education conditions usually include school enrollment and attendance on 80 percentC85 percent of school days, but in many cases, there are no measures of performance.

By 2011, at least 18 countries in Latin America had implemented such programs. Elsewhere, there are large-scale programs in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey and pilot programs in Cambodia, Malawi, Morocco, Pakistan, and South Africa, among others. Just in Latin America, the number of beneficiaries grew from 38 million in 2001 to 135 million in 2010.11

The largest programs in terms of absolute coverage are located in Mexico and Brazil. In Mexico, the program is called Oportunidades. It started in 1997 with 300,000 beneficiary households and now covers almost 6 million households. In Brazil, Bolsa Familia started in the municipalities of Brasilia and Campinas and now serves 11 million families (58 million people) countrywide. The smallest program in terms of coverage is located in Chile, serving 215,000 households. In terms of relative coverage, programs range from approximately 40 percent of the population (Ecuador) to about 20 percent (Brazil and Mexico) to 1 percent (Cambodia). Santiago Levy and Norbert Schady show that for 16 countries in Latin America, average coverage is one out of every four households.12

In terms of budget, the costs range from about 0.50 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in such countries as Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico to 0.08 percent of GDP (Chile). The generosity of benefits ranges from 20 percent of mean household consumption in Mexico to 4 percent in Honduras and even less for programs in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Pakistan.

	<b><a name="T13">IMPACT OF CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMS</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The impact of CCT programs individually is difficult to evaluate. Programs vary widely, both in the quality of their evaluation methods and in the extent of control and monitoring schemes. Governments that have adopted strict operational rules show more positive plausible results than those that have implemented more flexible designs or looser rules.

The ultimate goal of CCT programs is to alleviate and break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by inducing parents to use public health and education services for their children. In almost 15 years, these programs, both in Latin America and in the rest of world, have yielded mixed results. Following are case studies of Oportunidades in Mexico and Bono Juancito Pinto (BJP) in Bolivia.

	<b><a name="T14">Oportunidades</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Mexico’s Oportunidades program has its roots in a predecessor program, Progresa, initiated under President Ernesto Zedillo and the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in 1997. Progresa, the first large-scale CCT, focused on promoting education, health, and nutrition among the poor in rural Mexico. The program was submitted to evaluation after its first year, and studies demonstrated that it positively affected school attendance and the frequency of health clinic visits among its beneficiaries, in addition to reducing the number of families living in extreme poverty by nearly 3 percent during its first five years of operation.

Thus, despite initial skepticism, President Vicente Fox and the Partido Accion Nacional (PAN) decided to maintain the program upon coming to power in 2000. In 2002, Fox put his own stamp on the program, changing its name to Oportunidades, emphasizing the importance of co-responsibility between the government and the poor, and extending the program’s reach both to involve a greater proportion of the rural poor and to include the urban and semi-urban poor. The monthly cash transfer under Oportunidades is USD20 per family per month.

Since its beginning, Oportunidades has been subject to randomized evaluations, and results show that school enrollment and preventive health care utilization have increased. The program helped to increase enrollment in secondary school by 6 percentage points for boys and 9 percentage points for girls. For girls, who often drop out before secondary school, the number of those making the transition to secondary school increased by 15 percentage points. Children in the program also entered school at an earlier age and repeated fewer grades. Oportunidades had relatively little impact, however, on school attendance rates, on achievement on standardized tests, or in bringing dropouts back to school.

Health visits increased by 18 percent in Oportunidades localities, and illnesses among Oportunidades children up to five years old were reduced by 12 percent. Stunting was reduced in Oportunidades children by 10 points. Although the exact mechanism that triggers improvement is not known with certainty, it may result from one or several program characteristics, such as the provision of higher incomes that permit increased expenditure on food, growth monitoring and information about nutrition and child care, or nutritional supplements.

	<b><a name="T15">Bono Juancito Pinto</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	


Bolivia’s Bono Juancito Pinto program was implemented in 2006 by President Evo Morales to encourage parents to send their children to school. If a child attends school at least 80 percent of the time, parents receive approximately USD30 at the end of the academic year. This program is funded mainly by natural resource revenues from the state-owned oil and mining companies.

At the beginning, the bonus was supposed to be given only to students in public school between first and fifth grade. However, the government has relaxed the requirements each year, and since 2013, students in public school from first to tenth grade have received the bonus. The total amount spent in the program has increased from USD27 million in 2006 to USD60 million in 2013, which represents 0.25 percent of Bolivia’s nominal GDP. Student coverage has increased from 1 million to nearly 2 million. These numbers merit some skepticism. A comparison of numbers from the Minister of Economy, in charge of giving the bonus, and the Minister of Education shows that the number of students receiving the bonus every year is greater than the number of students enrolled in school each year.14

To date, no official evaluation document has been issued by the Bolivian government. However, a few attempts have been made recently to evaluate the program’s impact according to its objective. Using micro simulation techniques, Ernesto Yanez Aguilar finds that the BJP has had a positive impact on reducing school absenteeism in primary schools, has helped to reduce the extreme poverty rate, and has improved income distribution, especially in the rural sector.15 Flavia Marco Navarro shows that the program has had a positive impact on school attendance and a slight impact on the dropout rate, while the effect on enrollment is less clear.16





On the other hand, Sergio Daga and Roberto Orihuela find that the net enrollment rate for beneficiaries of the bonus (students from first to eighth grade) has not increased; actually, it decreased from 94 percent in 2006 to 82 percent in 2011.17 The drop is especially surprising given that the net enrollment rate for students that do not benefit from the bonus increased from 60 percent in 2005 to 70 percent in 2011. Additionally, the study shows that dropout rates among beneficiaries have decreased, so any possible impact of the bonus is unclear.

Most shocking is that the failure rate among beneficiaries of the bonus increased sharply from less than 1 percent in 2005 to 6.1 percent in 2011, while the failure rate among those who do not benefit from the bonus decreased from 7.4 percent in 2006 to 5.7 percent in 2011.

According to Santiago Levy and Norbert Schady, careful randomized evaluations of some CCT programs in Latin America have shown that, on average, they have increased school enrollment and attendance and the utilization of preventive health services.18 However, despite these apparently positive results, there are at least four main concerns.

	<hr><br>
	
While cash transfer programs have increased school enrollment, the evidence on whether the additional schooling results in better learning outcomes for children who were brought into school by these programs is mixed. Tania Barham, Karen Macours, and John Maluccio find that in Nicaragua, boys (but not girls) whose families received transfers from the Red de Proteccion Social program when they were between nine and 11 years of age have test scores that are approximately 0.2 standard deviations higher 10 years later.19

On the other hand, Jere Behrman, Susan Parker, and Petra Todd find that children in Mexico who received Progresa transfers do not have higher test scores than comparable children who did not receive them.20 Although the reasons for this finding are unclear, the poor quality of education and the fact that many of the children who were brought into school are drawn from the lower end of the distribution of ability are probably part of the explanation.

More generally, while conditional cash transfers have increased the utilization of health and educational services, impacts on final human capital outcomes have been more limited. As a result, the effect that conditional cash transfers have on reducing the intergenerational transmission of poverty―a key objective of these programs―may be limited.21

	<b><a name="T18">Reduced Incentives to Work</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
In some cases, the transfers may be so large that they can have a negative effect on incentives to work.22 In Ecuador and Mexico, transfers have increased substantially in magnitude. In Mexico’s Progresa (since renamed Oportunidades), transfers are now equivalent to over 40 percent of household pre-transfer income in the lowest quintile of the distribution. Transfer income also represents a sizeable share of total income in Ecuador, where the program is also very large in scope, covering almost 40 percent of the population. If leisure is a normal good, we might expect that the income effect of transfers of this magnitude would reduce labor supply.

Moreover, many of the cash transfer programs periodically “recertify” beneficiaries to ensure that they are still poor enough to qualify for continued eligibility. This obviously introduces an incentive for households to continue to be (or at least appear to be) poor. Adriana Camacho and Emily Conover show that once the exact formula used to calculate the proxy means test that determined eligibility for Colombia’s Familas en Accion program was made public, there was substantial heaping of households just below the cutoff value.23

In Chile (and in some other countries), having a household member with a physical or mental disability increases the value of the subsidy. Rodrigo Herrera, Osvaldo Larranaga, and Amanda Telias show that among the poorest households, almost 80 percent report having a household member with a disability on the Ficha de Proteccion Social, the survey that is used to determine assistance levels. In comparison, on the national CASEN household survey, which does not determine eligibility for transfers, only 20 percent of the poorest households report having a member with a disability.24

Conditional cash transfers can also favor informal over formal employment. The Uruguayan PANES program explicitly disqualified recipients if their formal sector earnings increased above a predetermined value. Verónica Amarante, Marco Manacorda, Andrea Vigorito, and Mariana Zerpa show that PANES substantially reduced formal employment among men and that these effects persisted at least two years after the program ended.25

	<b><a name="T20">Political Clientelism</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The political clientelism that CCT programs may create is a derivative effect that has yet to be fully investigated. Emerging and less developed economies have suffered from political clientelism, especially regarding social assistance programs, for a long time. As World Bank CCT scholar Laura Rawlings points out, traditionally, “there has been criticism of paternalism, clientelism and corruption in social assistance programs, many of which are perceived as vehicles for political patronage.”26 CCT programs seem to follow the same pattern.

Since CCT programs are generally administered by the central government, they invariably affect the relationship between program beneficiaries and the executive in the central government. Given this connection, certain features of CCT programs indicate that the executive is focused more on using the program for short-term political gains (earning political capital) than on attaining its long-term goals (building human capital to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty). The most salient features in this respect include the process of targeting beneficiaries, the degree of the central government’s involvement in program operations, the method of oversight, and the investment in the supply side of the program.

For example, the largest CCT program, Bolsa Familia in Brazil, has been very successful in targeting the poorest members of Brazilian society, but it has also done so in a way that inculcates significant allegiance to the central government among program beneficiaries. The combination of strong central government involvement in program operations, weak oversight of compliance with program conditions, and a lack of supply-side investment indicates that Bolsa Familia is more focused on short-term political goals than it is on long-term structural reform.

	<b><a name="T21">ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Honorable Obiageli Ezekwesili, a Nigerian citizen and then Vice President of the World Bank for Africa, highlighted the importance of economic freedom in fighting poverty in a lecture at The Heritage Foundation in October 2011.27 She stressed, based on a research paper published by Jean-Pierre Chauffour,28 that economic freedom and civil and political liberties are at the root of the reasons why some countries achieve and sustain better economic outcomes while others do not. The expansion of the conditions of freedom―whether economic, civil or political―over time positively influences long-run economic growth and therefore promotes higher income levels and lower poverty rates.

She also mentioned that the Index of Economic Freedom underlines the positive role that economic freedom plays in enabling prosperity, raising living standards, curbing poverty, and improving economic growth and social well-being. She quoted Nelson Mandela: “Money won’t create success; the freedom to make it will.”

Ms. Ezekwesili said that prioritizing economic freedom over social entitlements could be an effective way to reform the welfare state in many developing countries, especially if they want to make their economies more sustainable in the long run. In other words, deregulation, lower taxes, and less interference in the market would make these countries much more prosperous, not less, and ultimately eliminate the need for the state to engage in huge social spending that creates only more dependence and marginalization.

As noted, one of the strongest results of The Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom is that countries that prioritize economic freedom tend to be richer, tend to grow faster, and tend to reduce poverty faster, and their people tend to live longer and to be more educated. They tend to be less corrupt, to respect human rights more, to promote gender equity, and to have more of their people employed.
<a href= "pic17.html">CCT Programs</a><br><br>
Looking at the level of economic freedom in the countries that have implemented conditional cash transfer programs in recent years, it should not be surprising to see that the vast majority of them are considered either mostly unfree or just moderately free economies based on their average score in the Index of Economic Freedom in the past six years. (See Table 1.) Ecuador is an especially vivid case. This country is considered a repressed economy, and its CCT program has the highest relative coverage in terms of its total population, reaching more than 40 percent. (See Table 2.)

The countries that have implemented CCT programs have common features: They lack property rights, suffer from corruption, have rigid labor market laws, and restrict capital mobility. Investors’ perception is that governments in these countries do not provide adequate protection for their investments.

Under these circumstances, the ability of individuals in these countries to create and accumulate wealth, engage in entrepreneurial activities, and make long-term investment plans is constrained. Alleviating poverty in a sustainable way will be impossible in these countries until their governments remove the real obstacles that restrict economic freedom.

	<b><a name="T22">CONCLUSION</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The latest attempt to fight poverty is the idea of conditional cash transfers to the poor, a form of social assistance program that has become very popular in Latin America and more recently in Asia and Africa. Typically, such programs transfer money to the poor conditioned on the utilization of health and education public services. The main goal, according to proponents, is to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by the accumulation of sufficient human capital so that social assistance would no longer be needed in the future.

In countries where this was possible, careful randomized evaluations of some CCT programs have shown that, on average, they have increased school enrollment and attendance and the utilization of preventive health services. In others, where CCT programs were implemented under more flexible designs or looser rules, the positive impacts are less clear.

There are at least four main concerns that are likely to undercut the effectiveness of these programs. 
--Public services in most of the developing world still lack quality;
--In some cases, transfers may be so large that they can have a negative effect on incentives to work;
--There is evidence in some countries that cash transfers could favor informal over formal employment; and
--CCT programs affect the relationship between program beneficiaries and the government, with certain features of CCT programs designed apparently more to achieve short-term political gains than to attain their long-term stated development goals.

Every year, the results of The Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom reinforce the conclusion that the world’s freest economies have less human poverty and higher living standards. The countries that have made significant achievements in poverty reduction in a sustainable way have done it by implementing policies that prioritize rule of law, limited government interventions, regulatory efficiency, and open markets.

With a few exceptions, countries that have implemented conditional cash transfer programs lack property rights, suffer from corruption, have rigid labor market laws, restrict capital mobility, and offer few protections for investment. They would achieve better results if they focused more on removing barriers to economic freedom and less on actions that encourage more dependence on the state.
