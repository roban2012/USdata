Business Freedom<br><br>

Business freedom is an overall indicator of the efficiency of government regulation of business. The quantitative score is derived from an array of measurements of the ease of starting, operating, and closing a business.
<br><br>
The business freedom score for each country is a number between 0 and 100, with 100 indicating the freest business environment. The score is based on 10 factors, all weighted equally, using data from the World Bank’s Doing Business report:<br><br>
--Starting a business―procedures (number);<br><br>
--Starting a business―time (days);<br><br>
--Starting a business―cost (% of income per capita);<br><br>
--Starting a business―minimum capital (% of income per capita);<br><br>
--Obtaining a license―procedures (number);<br><br>
--Obtaining a license―time (days);<br><br>
--Obtaining a license―cost (% of income per capita);<br><br>
--Closing a business―time (years);<br><br>
--Closing a business―cost (% of estate); and<br><br>
--Closing a business―recovery rate (cents on the dollar).<br><br>

Each of these factors is converted to a scale of 0 to 100, after which the average of the converted values is computed. The result represents the country’s business freedom score in comparison to other countries. Even if a country requires the highest number of procedures for starting a business, which yields a score of zero in that factor, it could still receive a score as high as 90 based on scores in the other nine factors. Singapore, for instance, receives scores of 100 in nine of these 10 factors, but the 11 licensing procedures required by the government equate to a score of 68.2 for that factor, giving Singapore an overall business freedom score of 96.8.<br><br>

Each factor is converted to a scale of 0 to 100 using the following equation:<br><br>

Factor Scorei = 50 factoraverage/factori<br><br>

which is based on the ratio of the country data for each factor relative to the world average, multiplied by 50. For example, on average worldwide, it takes 15 procedures to get necessary licenses. Canada’s 11 licensing procedures are a factor value better than the average, resulting in a ratio of 1.15. That ratio multiplied by 50 equals the final factor score of 68.2.<br><br>

For the six countries that are not covered by the World Bank’s Doing Business report, business freedom is scored by analyzing business regulations based on qualitative information from reliable and internationally recognized sources.4
<br><br>
Sources. Unless otherwise noted, the Index relies on the following sources in determining business freedom scores, in order of priority: World Bank, Doing Business 2014; Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Commerce, 2010C2013; U.S. Department of Commerce, Country Commercial Guide, 2010C2013; and official government publications of each country.
