	<b><a name="T1">20th Anniversary</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Welcome to the 20th anniversary edition of the Index of Economic Freedom. What began as the brainchild of free-market economists in the 1980s is today a world-renowned landmark measuring economic progress in over 180 countries.

Each year, government officials from around the world tell us they pay close attention to their Index scores, using them as a guide for key policy decisions. Companies use the Index to guide investments and manage risk, and universities work it into their curricula. Its growing popularity is evident in the fact that the number of visits to its website,launched in 2001, has risen from nearly 700,000 in 2008 to almost 1.9 million in 2012 and is on track to surpass 2.4 million in 2013.

Why such success? The main reason is that the message of the Index rings true: More than any other political or policy approach, economic freedom generates more opportunities and greater well-being for more people, no matter where they live. Over the past two decades, the Index of Economic Freedom has documented the critical link between economic opportunity and prosperity. It has also demonstrated the power of free-market, limited-government, rules-based capitalism in helping people to prosper.

	<b><a name="T2">Creating an Index of Economic Freedom</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

The idea of creating an index to measure the impact of economic freedom in the world began percolating in the 1980s. Nobel laureate Milton Friedman talked of producing one, and it was discussed periodically at meetings of free-market economists during that decade.

In the late 1980s, one of the biggest policy interests in Washington was measuring the efficacy of foreign aid. In 1989, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Alan Woods proposed an “Economic Opportunity Index” to evaluate the U.S. government’s foreign aid programs.1 That same year, Heritage analyst Ed Hudgins analyzed the “Woods Report” in a Backgrounder and called on Congress to consider using such an index to rewrite the decades-old Foreign Assistance Act so as to improve the allocation of U.S. aid to developing countries.2 A few years later, in 1992, the chairman of the President’s Commission on the Management of AID Programs, George M. Ferris, and commission member Jack Kemp urged USAID to adopt a quantitative measure of economic freedom to help decide the allocation of U.S. foreign aid.3

Several members of Heritage’s Board of Trustees had expressed early interest in the notion of measuring economic freedom around the world. William E. Simon, former Secretary of the Treasury, and Ambassador J. William Middendorf II both had talked about quantitative measures that would permit comparative analysis on a national basis. The subject was debated in detail at Heritage Board Meetings and Ed Feulner, Heritage’s President, was encouraged to move ahead with the concept to see if it could develop into a usable product 

The decision to launch a formal Heritage project to produce the Index was made in 1993 after a conversation that I, as Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy Studies, had with then-Heritage President Ed Feulner. We were discussing our plans for the upcoming year when he asked whether I thought an index on economic freedom could be produced. I replied that many economists had talked a great deal about it but so far had been unable to agree on how to go about it.

I took Feulner’s question as a mandate to decide whether Heritage could succeed where others had failed. I went back and discussed the matter with my staff, particularly Jay Kingham Fellow in Regulatory Affairs Thomas Sheehy and a young analyst, Bryan T. Johnson. Then I recommended going forward.

In early 1994, Heritage experts were invited to testify before Congress on the idea of an Index of Economic Freedom. I testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Johnson appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sheehy testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on foreign aid. In his testimony, Sheehy discussed the need for creating an Index of Economic Freedom to help the U.S. government determine the best candidates for U.S. aid. A few months later, he went into more detail in a Heritage Backgrounder.4

The main question was how to create a methodology for an index. Throughout the early 1990s, the Fraser Institute, a Canadian-based think tank led by Michael Walker, had held a series of workshops to discuss the prospects for a world economic freedom index. Sometimes attended by Milton Friedman, who later chaired Fraser’s economic freedom project, the sessions examined the question of a methodology. Ed Hudgins, who led Heritage’s international economics center at that time, had attended them and shared the concerns raised and conclusions drawn with his Heritage colleagues. When we made the decision to develop a methodology, the task fell to Johnson. He conferred with Hudgins, who by that time had moved to the Cato Institute, and then devised the 10 factors we ultimately used for the first Index.

The aim from the outset was to make the methodology transparent and simple enough that non-economists, including Members of Congress and their staffs, would find it user-friendly. In practice, this meant using data that were readily available, reliable, and consistent. The Heritage methodology may not have captured all of the theoretical nuances of economic theory, but it did reflect the main economic and institutional factors involved in economic freedom and growth. The methodology was largely an in-house affair, operationalized by Johnson, who with Sheehy undertook the time-consuming task of grading over a hundred countries. By the second half of 1994, they were ready to go.

So, late in 1994, we launched our first Index of Economic Freedom5 in New York City. Feulner, co-authors Johnson and Sheehy, and I, as supervising editor, were there. Also present were former Treasury Secretary William Simon; National Review editor William F. Buckley; and Forbes magazine president and editor in chief Steve Forbes. At a private meeting with some of America’s most important CEOs, such as the president of American Express, the Heritage crew explained how the Index worked and, using a graph called “The Curve of Economic Freedom,” how it showed a statistically significant relationship between economic freedom and long-term growth.

That first Index was an instant success. According to Ed Feulner, “Former Treasury Secretary William Simon told me after reviewing a draft copy of The Index of Economic Freedom that it may well be the single most important publication ever published by The Heritage Foundation….”6 Milton Friedman told Johnson and me that he was “glad someone finally ended up doing this.” When we traveled to Hong Kong in early 1995 to release it overseas, our press conference attracted a huge number of media, kicking off that city’s long-running interest in keeping its Index ranking as the freest economy in the world. The Index was attracting national and global attention, even in its first edition, not only because of its compelling message on economic freedom, but also because it gave countries an easy way to measure and compare themselves on the world economic stage.

By 1997, the Index was so well known that William Simon advised the Air Force Academy to start a program on economic freedom. Ed Feulner was invited to present the concept to the Academy. That same year, at the request of Dow Jones CEO Peter Kann, the Editorial Page of The Wall Street Journal joined Heritage as the Index’s co-publisher; Melanie Kirkpatrick became a co-editor and, along with editorial page editor Robert Bartley, forged an exciting and constructive partnership with Heritage that lasts to this day.

In Asia, the Index had become so widely known that even average people had heard of it. Upon checking into a hotel in Singapore on one of the promotional tours in those early years, I was greeted by a clerk proclaiming, “We’re number two,” referring to Singapore’s Index score and revealing how much of a household name it had become there. In Croatia, popular evening TV quiz shows like our Jeopardy featured a question about that country’s Index score in 2007; two contestants actually cited Index statistics from memory.8

Naturally, with so much attention, the Index also came under heavy scrutiny. Some developmental economists objected to its criticism of government-to-government foreign aid programs. Liberal economists were hostile to the message on economic freedom. Some economists objected to our refusal to weight economic factors. But when the Fraser Institute’s first Economic Freedom in the World report8 appeared nearly two years after the first Index, its findings were not all that different from those of the Heritage Index even though it employed a more complicated methodology that weighted the relative importance of various factors. A 1997 Cato Institute study that compared the results of the Heritage and Fraser indexes concluded that, 
“[d]espite underlying differences in purpose, methodology, and philosophy, the various surveys produce rankings that have much in common.”9

One of the reasons the Index has fared so well is that its findings conform to economic reality and thus are not merely about theory. In his autobiography, published after he retired as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan summed up this point succinctly:

The ultimate test of the usefulness of such a scoring process [for example, the Index] is whether it correlates with economic performance. And it does. The correlation coefficient of 157 countries between their “Economic Freedom Score” and the log of their per capita incomes is 0.65, impressive for such a motley body of data.10

	<br>
	<b><a name="T3">Impact of the Index</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Over the years, the impact of the Index has fallen into distinct categories. The most important is its influence on government policies in countries in every region of the world. Topping the list is Hong Kong. Its government adopted the first Index as a key barometer in measuring its economic success. This interest persisted even after the handover of Hong Kong from the British to the People’s Republic of China on July 1, 1997. The government took out full-page advertisements in the press whenever it scored “number one” on the Index. Press conferences there with Heritage analysts are always jam-packed, treated as high-profile and almost official affairs. Indeed, press coverage of the Index release sometimes amounts to hundreds of articles in local and Asian papers.

The story that best demonstrates the impact of the Index on Hong Kong is the reaction to the 1999 edition, known as the “year of the asterisk.”11 Hong Kong had responded to the Asian economic crisis by purchasing large amounts of securities on the stock market. Since it occurred after the June 30 cutoff date for data for the 1999 edition, this action did not affect Hong Kong’s score that year. However, as the editors of the Index explained in an asterisk attached to its stillCnumber one ranking, if this action were not reversed, Hong Kong would lose its number one ranking in the next edition. In a tense meeting between the Heritage delegation, led by Ed Feulner, and then-Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, it was clear that something would have to give for Hong Kong to retain its coveted position.

And something did give. Before the data deadline for the 2000 edition, Hong Kong sold off the securities. As a result, it retained its position as the world’s “freest economy” in the 2000 Index,12 and the asterisk was dropped. It was clear to all that the Index had been the key factor in driving the decision (Hong Kong officials admitted as much to Feulner and other Heritage personnel). Most important, however, was how the rest of the world took note. Seeing the impact on Hong Kong, droves of embassy and foreign government officials began visiting Heritage to provide input, hoping to influence their country’s scores. One government went so far as to present me with a scoring of itself, complete with a perfectly formatted country page that matched the formatting style of the book.

Other areas of impact have involved U.S. law and policy. Following the release of the first edition, Representative Bob Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, used findings from the Index to reduce foreign aid by some 40 percent by fiscal year 1996.13 Other legislation was proposed in the 1990s, but none made its way into law because the Clinton Administration and Democrats in Congress opposed placing conditions on foreign aid. Eventually, however, in 2004, with George W. Bush in the White House, the impact of the Index on the way foreign aid would be distributed was recognizable in the work of a newly established U.S. government agency, the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Each year, the MCC requests our annual trade freedom score before the Index’s official release date to help it determine which countries will qualify for performance-based aid compacts.

Recognizing the importance of economic freedom and the usefulness of the Index as a policy tool, other international organizations such as the World Bank14 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development15 have featured Index results in their database and use our analysis and scoring in their studies on the effectiveness of development assistance. Notably, for the 2012 Index, the World Bank’s vice president for Africa contributed an essay highlighting the urgency of increasing economic freedom to improve development prospects.16 Index findings also have been used in other international indexes, such as the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Transformation Index17 and the Legatum Institute’s first Prosperity Index (published in 2009).18

Another target of influence for the Index is American corporations. After its release, Washington Post investment columnist James Glassman spoke favorably of that first Index in his Sunday column.19 In 2004, Steve Forbes called the Index “a superb source for business conditions in countless countries.”20 Robert Ulrich, Chairman and CEO of Target Corporations and Target Stores, reiterated that point in 2005, calling the Index an “important reference book for any business that invests overseas and is engaged in today’s global marketplace.”21 In 1996, executives at General Motors invited Tom Sheehy to Michigan to brief them on how the Index could be used to direct overseas investments.22 Bryan Johnson recalls Procter and Gamble integrating Index findings into its long-range investment plans and Franklin Templeton Investments using material from the Index in marketing its own products.23 Samson Capital Advisors has including Index findings in its analysis of currency returns, and in 2013, UBS Investment Research included information on Index country scores in its report to subscribers on global emerging markets.24 There has even been interest in creating a marketable fund based directly on the Index as a portfolio investment tool.

One of the most surprising uses of the Index is as an educational tool. It has become quite popular as a textbook and research source for high-school teachers and university professors. For example, Mark C. Green, Professor of Marketing at Simpson College, included a chart from the Index in his college textbook Global Marketing, which is used in courses at over 200 colleges and universities. Three widely used textbooks on economics published by McGraw-Hill drew on source materials from the Index. It was often used as well by scholars for their primary research work. Not only the raw data of scores, but the analyses provided in each year’s editions were often cited by scholars both here and abroad.25 Several Federal Reserve Banks (such as St. Louis, New York, Dallas, and Atlanta) have used Index materials in their educational outreach programs. The bank in St. Louis, for example, made the Index a centerpiece in its online education course called “Which Came First―Democracy or Growth?”26

The culmination of the Index’s history in American education, however, came under the tutelage of the current lead editor, Terry Miller. A former senior State Department diplomat who specialized in international economics, Miller undertook a major effort to highlight the Index as an educational tool. It is no surprise that the most enthusiastic response has come from graduate schools of international business, with Index data featured increasingly in scholarly research and exhibited annually at the Academy of International Business. Economic freedom is, after all, the foundation for economic and commercial success. Even more interesting, perhaps, has been the positive reception on undergraduate campuses for the Index’s message of revolutionary economic change and rapid development through individual empowerment.

Over the years, Heritage has partnered with a number of international think tanks and institutes in producing the Index and promoting the cause of economic freedom. Fourteen current partners are listed in the back of this volume. This year, the Index has its first international contributing editor, Sergio Daga of the Fundación Políticas Publicas para la LibertadCPOPULI in Bolivia. The Index or its major sections are now translated regularly into Spanish and Portuguese, and excerpts have appeared in French, Italian, Polish, and Bulgarian, among other languages.

	<b><a name="T4">Policy Lessons</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Equally important to the Index’s legacy are its policy lessons. Looking back on its 20 years of tracking economic freedom, certain of these lessons stand out. The Index has documented the linkage between economic freedom and long-term prosperity that had been suspected for some time, but as our editors and analysts have drilled further down into the rich accumulation of data and findings over these two decades, they have discovered other connections as well. We should pause and take a look at them.

The most prominent of these connections is the link between economic freedom and per capita GDP. As noted, the first edition of the Index included a chart called “The Curve of Economic Freedom.”27 Most of the statistical work for it was done by Heritage economist Bill Beach with the support of Bryan Johnson. Charting their findings showed a sweeping upward curve of economic freedom scores compared with per capita GDP, establishing with statistical certainty the connection between economic freedom and prosperity. In plain language, the more economically free a country is, the wealthier its people are. The linkage is unmistakable, and the data each year confirm it. Economists may argue about whether other factors such as education, roads, and natural resources lead to economic prosperity, but none could dispute that economic freedom is a key ingredient.

The link between prosperity (wealth measured by per capita GDP or income) and freedom was clear, but this did not answer the larger question of whether there was a link between economic freedom and economic growth. Drawing on strides in economic growth theory, Heritage economists Beach and Gareth Davis tackled this question in the 1997 edition. Using data developed by Harvard economists Robert Barro and Jong-Wha-Lee, they argued that “institutional settings strongly influence the rate of economic growth.”28 Their analysis showed a “statistically significant relationship,” at a 99 percent confidence level, between economic freedom and economic growth. For the 2000 edition, Barro himself contributed a chapter that extrapolated on this theme, concluding that property rights and the rule of law (but not democratic elections) were key determinants of economic growth.29 Barro revisited the issue in the 2013 edition of the Index, confirming his results with an updated data set.30

The relationship between economic freedom and democracy or political freedom is a long-standing issue. The year before Barro first tackled it, Bryan Johnson had looked at the relationship between economic freedom and political freedom. Conducting a regression analysis of data derived from the Index and Freedom House’s annual survey of political freedom, he concluded that “those countries that are more economically free also are more politically free and have higher levels of civil liberties than those countries with less economic freedom.”31 This confirmed what many had already expected: Advanced economies tend to be more democratic, while undeveloped ones are more often poor and undemocratic.

One of the most lasting lessons from the Index findings over these two decades is the importance of international trade for economic growth. This was a theme in the 2001 edition, which contained an essay by The Wall Street Journal’s Mary O’Grady titled “First, Open Markets.”32 O’Grady focused mainly on the benefits of free trade to Latin America, but she and others argued that the general effect of free trade was to encourage liberalization of all areas of the economy. Free trade, for example, makes it easier to protect property rights. Free trade agreements institutionalize market openings and encourage others to follow suit.

Because of the importance of this issue, I directed our Index analysts to pen a chapter for the 2001 edition on the arguments for creating a global free trade area.33 The idea was to bring together not only existing free trader nations, but also aspiring ones, creating global momentum in favor of open trade (particularly in the wake of the Asian economic crisis and the recent lack of progress in free trade talks). Variations of this idea were later picked up by presidential candidates such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney.

When Terry Miller took over as lead editor for the 2009 edition, he began to explore the larger universe of economic freedom. He wanted to understand better the broader benefits and how economic freedom related to other aspects of human development.

In the 2010 edition, for example, Miller compared data from the United Nations Human Development Reports’ “Human Poverty Index” with our economic freedom scores.34 He found that poverty rates dropped faster in economically free countries than in those that were losing economic freedom. He performed a similar comparative analysis of data on social instability and discovered that there was considerably more social unrest in countries that were economically repressed. The social benefits of economic freedom are widespread and palpable. As Miller concluded, “The prosperity that flows from economic freedom results in greater access to education, reduced illiteracy, increased access to higher quality health care and food supplies, and longer life expectancy.”35 The data from a broad spectrum of global sources made clear that the freer a country was, the greater would be the well-being of its people across the board.

In the 2011 edition, this comparative approach was taken to even higher levels. Using data from the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and other groups, former Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Ben Lieberman compared the environmental performance of 163 nations with Index scores on economic freedom.36 He discovered that a nation’s wealth “correlates highly” with the “Environmental Performance Index.” Since the wealthiest nations also happen to be the most economically free, he concluded that free economies do the best job of protecting the environment. The reason is straightforward: “One can think of environmental protection as a good that only prosperous societies can afford.”37 People struggling for economic survival do not have the luxury of worrying about or paying for cleaner water or air. The policy implication is obvious: If an environmentalist wants to protect the environment, he or she should advocate policies that promote economic freedom rather than more state-controlled environmental restrictions on the world’s poor and economically repressed countries.

Over the past few years, under the leadership of Miller and his assistant Anthony Kim, the Index has also played an important role in documenting the decline of economic freedom in the United States. The election of President Barack Obama in 2008 ushered in an era of high government spending, regulation, and new taxes. It was not long before these policies began to affect America’s ranking as one of the world’s freest economies. The U.S. dropped out of the top ranks of the freest economies in 2010. Its score dropped another spot in 2011 and ended up in 10th place in both editions preceding this one―and well below the other freest economies. Even Canada, with socialized medicine, scored higher. For over five years, as the Index documents, our nation’s economic freedom has been unambiguously eroded by excessive government spending and growth-stifling regulations, an unreformed tax system, and creeping cronyism that undermines the rule of law.

The last big change under Miller’s leadership has been the push to achieve truly universal coverage of countries around the world. The number of countries included in the Index has grown from 157 in 2007 to 186 in this year’s edition, making the Index by far the most comprehensive study of its type.

	<b><a name="T5">20 Years of Making a Difference</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Looking back on the 20 years of research in the Index of Economic Freedom, former Heritage President Ed Feulner explained to me the keys to its success:

It was its timeliness, continuity, and transparency that made the difference. It came out every year at the same time, so people could depend on using it to measure the progress of economic freedom. It built up a huge base of data that policymakers and scholars could use to make comparisons and draw broader conclusions. And it was easy to understand and simple to use.

As one of the founders of the Index, I would add that the research quality and dedication of the Heritage people involved, including all of the country and regional experts, has made a huge difference. Our partnership with The Wall Street Journal, particularly in the early days with Melanie Kirkpatrick and later with Mary O’Grady, obviously has been a key to its success. It helped to bring wider recognition, and input from their editors has contributed to making the Index a world-class product. I have been privileged to work with them and others, both in and outside of Heritage, who are among the best minds in the business. I will always be thankful for the opportunity to have been part of this wonderful enterprise.

	<b><a name="T6">The Benefits of Free Trade</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Benefits of Free Trade: A Guide For Policymakers<br><br>

By Denise H. Froning<br><br>
International trade is the framework upon which American prosperity rests. Free trade policies have created a level of competition in today's open market that engenders continual innovation and leads to better products, better-paying jobs, new markets, and increased savings and investment. Free trade enables more goods and services to reach American consumers at lower prices, thereby substantially increasing their standard of living.
<br><br>
Moreover, the benefits of free trade extend well beyond American households. Free trade helps to spread the value of freedom, reinforce the rule of law, and foster economic development in poor countries. The national debate over trade-related issues too often ignores these important benefits.
<br><br>
The positive effects of an open market are clearly evident in the stellar growth of the U.S. economy over the past decade. Since 1990, the U.S. economy has grown by more than 23 percent, adding more than USD2.1 trillion to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) and raising the wealth of the average American consumer by more than USD5,500.2 The economy responded well to the expansion of trade that occurred after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 and the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 as a forum for settling trade disputes. For example:<br><br>

--Since 1990, imports of real goods and services have increased 115 percent.
<br><br>

--The number of full-time jobs has increased by 13.4 percent since 1991. The share of the labor force that works part-time because of an inability to find a full-time job is less than 3 percent.
<br><br>

--As of July 2000, the unemployment rate had hovered within one-tenth of a point from 4 percent for almost a year--the lowest rate in 30 years.3 
<br><br>

--The stellar record of growth has continued in the United States at the end of the decade as well: Between 1998 and 1999 alone, total employment increased by 2 million.4 
<br><br>

To be sure, many more policymakers today acknowledge the benefits of free trade than when Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Smoot-Hawley Act). The devastation wrought by these protectionist tariffs led successive U.S. administrations to support free trade after World War II. Their grand vision of a world comprised of nations at peace who traded freely among themselves for the prosperity of all has animated U.S. foreign policy and invigorated efforts to facilitate the opening of markets in every region.
<br><br>
A growing number of countries continue to share the benefits of America's emphasis on trade. As noted in a recent report by the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission chaired by Allan H. Meltzer, a former member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and Professor of Political Economy at Carnegie Mellon University:
<br><br>
The Congress, successive administrations, and the American public can be proud of these achievements. The United States has been the leader in maintaining peace and stability, promoting democracy and the rule of law, reducing trade barriers, and establishing a transnational financial system. Americans and their allies have willingly provided the manpower and money to make many of these achievements possible. The benefits have been widely shared by the citizens of developed and developing countries.<br><br>

The dynamic American economy benefited along with the rest of the world. Growth of trade spread benefits widely. Per capita consumption in the United States tripled. As in other countries, higher educational attainment, improved health services, increased longevity, effective environmental programs, and other social benefits accompanied or followed economic gains.5<br><br>

Despite these achievements, the United States, with one of the world's most open markets, continues to apply barriers to trade--most notably tariffs and quotas in the apparel and textile industry and in agriculture--that increase the cost of goods for consumers and harm people in developing countries who rely on this trade for their meager incomes. In this respect, the trade and Development Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-200) enacted on May 18, 2000, by lowering some of these barriers to trade, is a step in the right direction.
<br><br>
Congress and the President should take every opportunity to articulate the benefits of trade to the American people and to expand international trade by any possible means, such as the unilateral lowering of trade barriers, the forging of regional and bilateral trade agreements, and working within international trade forums like the WTO. Ultimately, the straightforward and tangible benefits that derive from each of these steps will help both hardworking American families and impoverished people around the world.

BENEFITS OF FREE trade<br><br>

The benefits of free trade are many and far outweigh any risks that foreign competition might pose to the U.S. economy. These benefits fall into four major categories.<br><br>


Benefit #1: Free trade promotes innovation and competition.<br><br>

Few people in America today sew all their own clothes, grow all their own food, build their own houses, or buy only products made in their own states. It would cost too much and take too much time, especially since Americans can acquire such items on the open market with relative ease. The same principle of practicality and cost applies on an international scale. It makes economic sense to buy a product from another who specializes in such production or who can make it more easily or for less cost.<br><br>

Indeed, access to a greater variety of goods and services is the purpose of trade. Imports, then, are not a sacrifice, a necessary evil for the good of exporting. One exports so that one may acquire goods and services in return. This logic is evident on a personal level as well: A person works so that he has the means to buy necessities and possibly even luxuries. One does not make purchases in order to justify working.<br><br>

Free trade is the only type of truly fair trade because it offers consumers the most choices and the best opportunities to improve their standard of living. It fosters competition, spurring companies to innovate and develop better products and to bring more of their goods and services to market, keeping prices low and quality high in order to retain or increase their market share.<br><br>

Free trade also spurs innovation. The U.S. market has demonstrated repeatedly, particularly over the last decade, that competition leads to increasing innovation. This is evident, for example, in the intense competition to create the latest personal computer at the lowest cost. With the growth of electronic commerce has come unlimited choices of goods and services and lower prices for products. Computers are now available for free just for signing an annual Internet provider service agreement.6<br><br>

In fact, America's greatest advantage lies in its ability to innovate and to build upon that continually expanding knowledge base. According to The Economist , the United States "has an `innovational complex'--those thousands of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and engineers--unmatched anywhere in the world."7 This resource results in an ever-growing number of new products and services that bolster America's competitive advantage in the global market and greater prosperity at home.<br><br>

This competitive advantage derives largely from America's open market practices. Free trade promotes innovation because, along with goods and services, the flow of trade circulates new ideas. Since companies must compete with their overseas counterparts, American firms can take note of all the successes as well as the failures that take place in the global marketplace. Consumers then benefit because companies in a freely competing market must either keep up with the leader in order to retain customers or innovate to create their own niche.<br><br>

In contrast, protectionist policies designed to restrict foreign competition exact a heavy cost on consumers. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the European Union (EU), which protects, for example, its members' agriculture industries from foreign competition through such policies as restricting imports of beef and maintaining a protectionist regime on bananas.<br><br>

In June 1999, testifying before the Senate Committee on agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry on the need to reform the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky observed that
<br><br>
The European CAP, including USD60 billion in trade-distorting subsidies, and 85 percent of the world's agricultural export subsidies, is among the largest distortions of world trade in any sector. Reform is in everybody's interest. The combination of high tariffs and subsidies make European consumers pay prices far above world markets for food. Export subsidies, in particular, place an immense and unfair burden on farmers in other countries, especially developing countries.8<br><br>

The end result of these policies has been to deprive consumers across Europe of access to more goods at fairer prices.
<br><br>
Though Ambassador Barshefsky's statement demonstrates that the Clinton Administration has recognized the negative impact of protectionist policies, protectionism continues to thrive in America's own agriculture sector, perpetuated by federal subsidies on products such as peanuts and sugar.
<br><br>
The common misperception that American farmers need subsidies to survive belies the evidence that American farmers themselves have amassed--evidence that is a tribute to their efficiency and hard work. By using the innate talent to innovate that Americans have developed so well, farmers have vastly increased productivity over the years. In fact, between 1948 and 1996, U.S. agricultural labor productivity increased more than eightfold, and agricultural production doubled, even as total input use (including labor, land, and machinery) declined.9
<br><br>
Clearly, removing counterproductive barriers to competition, such as quotas and tariffs that limit access and competition, is both good economic policy and good public policy.
<br><br>

Benefit #2: Free trade generates economic growth.
<br><br>
By fostering opportunities for American businesses, free trade rewards risk-taking by increasing sales, profit margins, and market share. Companies can choose to build on those profits by expanding their operations, entering new market sectors, and creating better-paying jobs. According to U.S. Trade Representative Barshefsky, U.S. exports support over 12 million jobs in America, and trade-related jobs pay an average of 13 percent to 16 percent higher wages than do non-trade-related jobs.10
<br><br>
Opponents of free trade fear that efforts to remove protectionist barriers to foreign competition will result in the loss of blue-collar jobs in America, especially in the manufacturing sector. They believe that the North American Free Trade Agreement in particular threatens these jobs. Yet, as Chart 1 (page 5) shows, the facts belie this fear.
<br><br>
The nature of employment in the United States is indeed evolving away from manufacturing and toward more service-oriented and high-technology jobs. However, the record shows that trading freely with America's NAFTA partners, Canada and Mexico, has not resulted in an aggregate loss of manufacturing jobs. Instead, since 1994:
<br><br>
--14 million new American jobs have been reported;
<br><br>

--The unemployment rate in America has fallen from 6 percent to 3.9 percent (as of April 2000); and

<br><br>
--The number of manufacturing jobs in America has remained steady, employing 18.3 million people in 1994 and 18.4 million in 1999, which represents 14 percent of the total American workforce.11 

<br><br>
On balance, not only has NAFTA not resulted in a loss of factory jobs in the United States, but it has not led to a loss in real wages for manufacturing workers. The average real wage in the manufacturing sector rose from USD8.03 per hour in 1994 to USD8.26 per hour in 1999 (in constant inflation-adjusted dollars).12
<br><br>
Moreover, saving just one job in America's declining apparel and textile industry is estimated to cost the taxpayers more than USD100,000 each year.13 The workforce in this sector, which has declined by approximately 30 percent since 1989, comprises just 1 percent of total non-farm employment. The decline is a natural outcome, considering that the industry pays far less than the average national wage--nearly 20 percent less in textiles and 33 percent less in apparel.14 Such lower-paying jobs become marginal as workers move to better-paying jobs in the broader market. In fact, over the past decade, 19 million more jobs have become available,15 demonstrating that there are many opportunities for American workers to find jobs.

<br><br>



Since NAFTA took effect, total U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico has risen more than 86 percent--from USD299 billion in 1993 to more than USD550 billion in 1999. U.S. exports surpassed USD2,350 billion in 1999, making up slightly more than 25 percent of overall GDP and more than 15 percent of all global trade.16
<br><br>
The growth in the U.S. economy also benefits people in poor countries who have access to the U.S. market, where both the demand for goods and services and levels of remuneration are much higher than they would be at home. To trade at this level enables their nascent businesses to acquire capital, fueling production and fostering the development of new industries. Impoverished people gain the opportunity to earn better wages, acquire more goods, and raise their standard of living.
<br><br>
In other words, this is a win-win scenario for Americans and people of countries that have been mired in poverty despite years of foreign aid.17 The advantage for poor countries in being able to trade for capital--rather than having to rely on ineffective assistance programs that are subject to waste or fraud--is that the payoff is more immediate in their private sectors. Foreign investment allows their domestic industries to develop and provide better employment opportunities for local workers. This dynamic makes an increase in foreign direct investment one of the most important benefits of free trade for developing nations.18
<br><br>

Benefit #3: Free trade disseminates democratic values.
<br><br>
Free trade fosters support for the rule of law. Companies that engage in international trade have reason to abide by the terms of their contracts and international agreed-upon norms and laws. The World Trade Organization, for example, compels its member countries to honor trade agreements and, in any trade dispute, to abide by the decisions of the WTO's mediating body.
<br><br>
By supporting the rule of law, free trade also can reduce the opportunities for corruption. In countries where contracts are not enforced, business relationships fail, foreign investors flee, and capital stays away. It is a downward spiral that especially hinders economic development in countries where official corruption is widespread. As Alejandro Chafuen, President of the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, has noted, "True economic freedom is possible only under a system of limited government with a strong rule of law. Economic freedom has little value if corruption in government means that only a few will enjoy it."19
<br><br>
trade likewise can falter quickly in countries where customs officials expect kickbacks at every checkpoint. In Western Africa, customs officials can stop trucks carrying goods as often as every hundred yards just to collect another bribe, as Mabousso Thiam, executive secretary of the West African Enterprise Network, testified at a 1999 Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) conference on corruption.20 Such arbitrary checkpoints spring up when countries cannot pay their customs officials livable wages, forcing them to choose between remaining honest but failing to bring home enough money to feed their families or taking an illegal bribe, as others often do. As U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has observed,
<br><br>
Corruption is built on everything being in the hands of the government. So for everything you want, you need a permit. The person who gives you the permit wants a bribe. The person who's going to make the appointment for you wants a bribe. And so on.21
<br><br>
Free trade, reinforced by the rule of law, removes such incentives for corruption by spurring economic growth, increasing the number of better-paying jobs, and ultimately increasing the level of prosperity.
<br><br>
But free trade transmits more than just physical goods or services to people. It also transmits ideas and values. A culture of freedom can flourish whenever a great society, as 18th century economist Adam Smith termed it, emerges with the self-confidence to open itself to an inflow of goods and the ideas and practices accompanying them. A culture of freedom can become both the cornerstone and capstone of economic prosperity.
<br><br>

Benefit #4: Free trade fosters economic freedom.
<br><br>
As the foregoing discussion shows, the ability to trade freely increases opportunity, choices, and standards of living. Countries with the freest economies today22 generally have adopted a capitalist model of economic development, remaining open to international trade and investment. These countries include the United Kingdom and many of its former colonies and dominions: Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, the United States, Australia, and Canada.
<br><br>
Chile, which benefits from a diverse European heritage, likewise demonstrates that basing economic policies on a capitalist free-market model brings good results in that region as well.
<br><br>
Heritage's analysis of the 161 countries covered in the Index of Economic Freedom , published annually with The Wall Street Journal , indicates that free trade policies can foster development and raise the level of economic freedom. Every day in the marketplaces of free countries, individuals make choices and exercise direct control over their own lives. As economic growth occurs, note World Bank economists David Dollar and Aart Kraay, the poorest people can benefit just as much as--and in some cases more than--the wealthy.23 With a sound infrastructure based on economic freedom, assured property rights, a fair and independent judiciary, the free flow of capital, and a fair system of low taxation, poor countries can create an environment that is friendly to trade and inviting to foreign investors.

<br><br>
 Consider the experience of China and Taiwan. In 1960, real per capita income in the People's Republic of China tracked closely with that of the Republic of China on Taiwan. In the late 1960s, however, the government in Taipei chose to institute widespread reforms to guarantee private property, establish a legal system to protect property rights and enforce contracts, reform the banking and financial systems, stabilize taxes, distribute public land to individuals, and allow the market to flourish. The result for Taiwan has been an astounding record of economic growth. (See Chart 2.)
<br><br>
The 2000 Index of Economic Freedom ranks Taiwan as the 11th freest economy in the world. With its economic freedom came the rise of democratic institutions. For the first time since the ruling party (the Kuomintang, or KMT) established a government in Taipei 50 years ago, a democratic transition of power took place in Taiwan as Chen Shui-bian, a candidate from a previously outlawed opposition party, assumed the presidency on May 20, 2000.
<br><br>
Despite this success, opponents of permanent normal trade relations with China argue that trade and economic liberalization will not bring democracy to mainland China or improve its human rights record. These critics assert that democracy is simply too foreign to the mainland--an argument that ironically echoes the mutterings of Asian authoritarian regimes about "Asian values." The development of political and economic freedom in Taiwan refutes such claims and points to the potential that more political and economic freedom can develop in China. Such an outcome would be in America's best interest> because it would enhance regional stability, increase prosperity for the Chinese, and open China's immense market to Americans.
<br><br>
The U.S. trade agreement with China signed by the Clinton Administration in November 1999 is a step in the right direction. It will help open the Chinese market to American exports and foreign direct investment to an unprecedented degree. Economic freedom is the biggest benefit of trade extension, both for American companies looking to invest in China and for the Chinese people themselves. These foundations of economic freedom not only will allow the Chinese people to gain access to the outside world, but also will expose the Chinese government to--and compel it to enforce--the international consensus on the rule of law. Such issues as property rights and honoring contracts, which companies historically have found to be a problem when trying to make deals in China, will be subject to a higher force.
<br><br>
Establishing the backbone of property rights and free-market policies is essential for creating the sort of market stability that is important to foreign investors. In countries with an established rule of law that does not ebb and flow from one leader to the next, foreign investors are more confident and willing to take risks in bringing businesses into developing nations. It is one reason Taiwan and Hong Kong, for example, have flourished over the past few decades.24
<br><br>
Taiwan's success demonstrates that if China opens its market, economic and political freedom will have a real chance to develop. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, by approving permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) with China on May 24, 2000, demonstrated their confidence in economic freedom by voting to lend U.S. assistance to this endeavor through freer economic exchange. Members of the U.S. Senate will have the same opportunity to endorse economic freedom when they vote on the matter in September.
<br><br>



It is reasonable to wonder how the concept of economic freedom, the fruits of which are so easily identified in wealthier countries, can apply to desperately poor countries that are concerned primarily with food supplies and access to running water and electricity. How does one draw conclusions from an apples-to-oranges comparison of prosperous high-technology countries, where children surf daily on the Internet using the family computer, and low-income nations like Burkina Faso where most children live in families that scrape by on little more than subsistence-level farming.
<br><br>
Indian economist Barun Mitra explains it succinctly: "Traders in the marketplace are like voters in a democracy. If [the] free flow of ideas is essential to sustain political freedom and a democratic polity, then free trade is critical to sustain economic freedom and an efficient marketplace. Liberty, after all, is indivisible."25 Countries that suffer under overregulation, corruption, and the lack of the rule of law benefit by removing barriers to trade and allowing their citizens to participate directly in the global marketplace.
<br><br>
Often, countries in Asia and the West can be widely disparate in the cultural and political realms, with economic repression and economic freedom existing in both regions. Nonetheless, a basic structure upon which to build economic freedom can be found in countries as different as Bahrain (an Arab monarchy), Singapore (an authoritarian city-state), the United States (a constitutional democracy), and Switzerland (a federal system of cantons encompassing at least four different cultures).
<br><br>
As a whole, sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree and poorest area in the world; but as the Index analysis shows, its poverty is not the result of insufficient levels of foreign aid: On a per capita basis, many sub-Saharan African countries receive the world's highest levels of economic assistance.26 Rather, the main causes of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa are the lack of economic freedom embodied in self-imposed policies, and systemic and rampant corruption.
<br><br>
In fact, corruption is a cancer on the most legitimate efforts to promote economic development in many of these countries. While this is hardly a problem unique to Africa or developing nations, it is all the more damaging to them. The outlook for this region is not hopeless, however: Mauritius, which received the highest Index ranking in the region, has had some success in adopting free-market practices. Compared with other countries in its region, it merits relatively favorable scores in black market activity and regulation.
<br><br>
The Index findings for sub-Saharan Africa cast doubt on the assertion that huge transfers of wealth from industrialized nations to the less developed world will result in economic growth. The people of Zimbabwe and Congo, to name just two examples, are not poor because people in the West do not share enough of their wealth with them. They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic policies that depress free enterprise or allow corrupt practices to derail the rule of law. Only when their ruling regimes increase economic freedom and unleash the power of the free market can these people embark on the road to prosperity. Anything short of free trade policies will continue to be both economically unwise and inhumane.
<br><br>
The United States can promote economic freedom in these countries through more effective means than economic assistance. As noted above, the United States imposes tariffs that add to the cost of selling products in the U.S. and makes imported goods less competitive with domestic products. Although America's average tariff rate of 2 percent is low by global standards,27 the United States does not apply its tariff rate evenly on products that it purchases from its trading partners. Instead, it applies the tariffs according to the types of goods that reach America's shores.
<br><br>
Regrettably, the goods that face the highest U.S. tariffs are precisely those produced by the poorest countries, such as agricultural goods, textiles, and apparel. The high level of tariffs combined with the impact of quotas is prohibitive for countries struggling to create a presence in the global marketplace and lift their people out of decades of poverty.
<br><br>
This disparity in tariff rates exists primarily because poor countries tend to export more of the types of commodities that are subject to high U.S. tariffs. Low-income countries develop industries that meet the basic needs of their people and for which they have a comparative advantage. The textile and apparel industries and agriculture are key economic activities because they satisfy domestic needs and do not require sophisticated machinery or large amounts of capital to turn a profit. What they do require--and what these nations have--is a large labor force.
<br><br>
Consider Nepal and Bangladesh, in which textile and apparel products make up 85 percent and 77 percent of total exports, respectively.28These countries, with per capita GDPs of less than USD300 each, face significant obstacles in trying to sell their products in the U.S. market. The average U.S. tariff rates on their products are 13.2 percent and 13.6 percent, respectively--more than six times the U.S. average.
<br><br>
The impact of these tariffs depends on their size and the responsiveness of U.S. consumers to the price changes on the products. In the case of some textile and apparel29 and agricultural imports, consumers are highly sensitive to price changes and will buy a domestic product rather than an imported one should the latter become too expensive. For example, for every 1 percent increase in the tariff rate for imported knitted fabrics, consumption of domestic knitted fabrics increases by over 2.9 percent.30 Thus, even a small increase in the tariff rate will discourage the purchase, and ultimately the production, of these imports, restricting primarily the access of developing countries to America's large market.
<br><br>
Ironically, any benefits that the tariffs may produce for the U.S. economy are miniscule compared with the total cost Americans pay for this protection. Economists at the Institute for International Economics estimate that consumers would save USD70 billion if the United States eliminated all tariffs and quantitative restrictions on imports--or about USD750 per American household.31 Approximately 35 percent of these gains--or USD24.4 billion--would accrue from liberalizing the apparel and textile sector. This is the purpose of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, which requires that all quotas on textile imports must be eliminated by 2005.
<br><br>
In the end, tariffs the United States applies to protect a sector that is naturally in decline will impose a significant cost on American consumers and the people of the low-income countries who make the products and lack other job opportunities. When a factory shuts down in Bangladesh or Nepal (in part because of the impact of prohibitive U.S. tariffs on its products), the unemployed have no safety net and few alternatives.
<br><br>
By comparison, the United States offers displaced workers numerous opportunities to find new jobs. The trade Adjustment Assistance program, for example, helps people who lose their manufacturing jobs as a result of foreign imports to apply for welfare benefits and receive job training and job search and relocation assistance. The unemployed in America are able to find a new job in a median of 6.4 weeks.32
<br><br>
Reducing America's tariffs, promoting bilateral and regional free trade agreements, and working within the World Trade Organization to promote economic freedom through international trade is the best way to help Americans and the peoples of the developing world. The September 2000 vote in the U.S. Senate on granting China permanent normal trade relations will be both a key test of America's commitment to free trade and a crucial opportunity to improve economic freedom and choice for people in both the United States and China.
<br><br>

Conclusion
<br><br>
Societies that enact free trade policies create their own economic dynamism--fostering a wellspring of freedom, opportunity, and prosperity that benefits every citizen. In recent years, the United States has demonstrated the power of this principle. Nor are American citizens alone in benefiting from those free trade policies that the U.S. enacts. By breaking the cycle of poverty, America's free trade policies can enable even the most impoverished countries to begin to create their own dynamic toward prosperity.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, despite all the evidence to the contrary, the opponents of free trade will continue to espouse the old argument that "the jobs created by globalization are often less sustaining and secure than the livelihoods abolished by it [in poor countries]."33 Such a claim presupposes that some sort of agrarian utopia previously existed in these countries and that their peoples will not reap the benefits of economic development.
<br><br>
Clamoring to stop this wave of economic progress carried forward by technology and innovation is akin to arguing that the United States, to cite just one example, was better off before the Industrial Revolution. While one might argue that this was true of the white male members of the landed classes (although even then such a claim is dubious), for the majority of the population that did not enjoy such luxury, quality of life has improved immeasurably.
<br><br>
The Industrial Revolution brought freedom of movement and increased opportunity to all economic levels of society. It also set the stage for social and democratic progress of a magnitude that would have been impossible earlier. And although history suggests that this new era of market globalization may well be accompanied by new problems for which the solutions once again will lie in the power of human ingenuity and innovation, it also presents an unprecedented level of opportunity for people to achieve economic freedom and greater prosperity.

A benefit of watching the ebb and flow of economic freedom over a long career in journalism is that you earn some standing to draw conclusions. One lesson I’ve learned is that prosperity is not a national birthright. It must be earned by each new generation in every country on Earth, even those that have long been prosperous. Another lesson is that the right policy choices are not self-replicating but must be relearned and fought for again and again. There are no permanent victories in the war of ideas, but the saving grace is that there are also no permanent defeats.

Those lessons shine brightly through the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom, perhaps even more now than in any previous year since The Wall Street Journal embarked with The Heritage Foundation on this scorecard of economic liberty. Some of the biggest gainers this year, as in recent years, were thought to be hopeless cases a generation ago.

One such group is the former nations of the Soviet Union, which had only recently broken apart in 1995, the Index’s first year. The Baltic States have tried to follow the Hong Kong and Singapore example of small nations opening themselves to capital and competition, and they have largely prospered because of it. Estonia now ranks 11th in the Index, one spot ahead of the United States. Lithuania is 21st and Latvia is 42nd, despite having endured brutal recessions in the past decade. They reformed their economies, shrank the size of their governments, and let the talents of their people emerge. The French and Italians could learn from their examples.

Chile, which was once close to following the lawless statism of Argentina, now ranks 7th. It is on the cusp of being considered a developed country, which is a just reward for good policy but carries the risk that its people may forget what made them prosperous. In its recent presidential election, Chile’s electorate rejected its center-right ruling party and tilted to the populist left. Next year’s policy trend in Santiago will be worth watching.

The electorate in Malaysia, meanwhile, rewarded its ruling party with another term after it made a priority of easing some political and economic controls and inviting foreign investment. The reforms arguably helped the UMNO coalition beat back a strong challenge from a rising middle class that also wants more freedom to express itself politically. Malaysia ranks 37th in the Index compared to 87th in 2004, and it too is reaching toward developed-country status.

On the other hand, countries can quickly descend in the ranks, even nations with a proud history of free markets. The U.S. is the most dispiriting example, given its history and its continued importance to global growth. America’s freedom score has declined for seven years in a row and now ranks 12th, just ahead of Bahrain and four spots behind Mauritius.

The U.S. is the classic case of having forgotten the hard-earned lessons of the recent past. America pulled itself out of the despond of the 1970s with policies of lower taxes, less regulation, steady monetary policy, and spending restraint. A two-decade boom followed with little interruption. Then a kind of collective amnesia set in during the 2000s that led to major policy errors and a credit mania, followed by a panic and crash that created a new political opening for those who wanted to expand state control of finance, health care, and energy markets. The last two years of the Bush presidency and first two Obama years marked the largest expansion of state power in the U.S. since the 1930s.

A political reaction in 2010 slowed government’s rise, but the economic damage has been extensive and continues to be felt in subpar growth, mediocre business investment, and fewer job prospects for the poor and less skilled. This dismal record, combined with the failed launch of Obamacare, may create a new opening for the forces of freedom. That will also require a new political champion who can make the arguments for liberty that a younger generation has never learned and hasn’t heard from a Republican presidential nominee since Reagan.

Though it pains this American a little to write it, another lesson of 20 years of this Index is that the spread of good economic ideas doesn’t depend as much as it once did on America. The diffusion of ideas and experience through modern communication and the Internet means that there are followers of Hayek in Shanghai and admirers of Milton Friedman in Mexico. Perhaps other nations will now take the global lead in showing the way toward rising incomes for all, especially the poor, as America tries to find its way back to the principles of liberty that made it great.

In 1995, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon described the Index of Economic Freedom as “the most important study The Heritage Foundation has ever published.” As the Index celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2014, we have the opportunity to look back and see whether the publication has lived up to its promise, in Simon’s words, to “revolutionize the debate over … global economic development.”

In a special essay that leads off the book this year, founding editor Kim R. Holmes traces the development of the Index over the past two decades, from its birth as the brainchild of a small group of free-market economists inspired by the renowned Milton Friedman through its development into what has been described as “an essential guide to growth for those who want to understand why some countries prosper and others lag behind.”

New Index co-editor Anthony B. Kim looks at the issue from a different direction, charting the progress over the 20 years of the Index’s history of those countries that have most vigorously pursued principles of economic freedom. His conclusion is not surprising: Countries that have sustained higher levels of economic freedom have achieved levels of prosperity unheard of in the history of humankind.

It is no coincidence that the explosion of economic liberty has coincided with a massive reduction in worldwide poverty, disease, and hunger. The acceptance of the free-market system as the fundamental basis for economic development in almost every country has provided a foundation for economic growth and human progress throughout the world.

A successful life, of course, is not just about economic prosperity. Freedom itself, whether political or economic, physical or spiritual, may be among the highest attainments of civilization. Amartya Sen, a Nobel Prize winner in economics, has written that “[t]he success of a society is to be evaluated … primarily by the substantive freedoms that the members of that society enjoy.” In the 2014 Index, Professor John Tomasi of Brown University expands on this theme, arguing that economic freedom not only produces massive economic and social benefits, but also is the most moral of societal arrangements and a societal good in its own right.

The 20-year database that now supports the analysis in the Index of Economic Freedom has proven to be an invaluable tool for policymakers, researchers, and academics. Yet I think that it may be even more important for those who continue the struggle to advance freedom, and especially economic freedom, around the world. People will not fight for freedom unless they understand it, value it, and believe it is at risk. For champions of freedom, the Index provides an objective measure of their country’s progress, or lack thereof, in fostering an environment that unleashes the ingenuity and energy of individuals who, through the “invisible hand” of the free market, promote the good of all through the pursuit of their own personally defined goals.

For Americans like me, who have benefitted from the legacy of a society justly called the “land of the free,” the 2014 Index paints a disturbing picture. The overall world progress in advancing economic freedom is a source of both satisfaction and pride, given the historical record of the United States in promoting and defending freedom. And yet the recent record of the United States in the Index―seven consecutive years of declining economic freedom―is a serious cause for alarm. Families, businesses, and community organizations across America, what the 18th century philosopher Edmund Burke dubbed the “little platoons” of society, are being squeezed by the government’s assault on our economic freedom. As a result, we have fewer pathways to individual and collective success.

As my predecessor as President of The Heritage Foundation, Ed Feulner, is wont to say, “There are no permanent victories.” Indeed, the struggle for freedom is one that must be renewed by every generation. As the Index of Economic Freedom reaches its 20th year, it is time for a new generation of Americans, and freedom-loving people around the world, to join in the struggle for economic freedom. As President Ronald Reagan once reminded us:


You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man’s age-old dream―the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order―or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.

The Index of Economic Freedom provides ample examples of successful policies proven in action. It is up to the people to provide the political will to implement them.

The 2014 Index of Economic Freedom is the 20th anniversary edition. For two decades, the Index, a joint publication of The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal, has tracked the progress of economic freedom around the globe, evolving into a data-driven practical policy guidebook that covers 186 countries encompassing 99 percent of the world’s population.
--The 20th edition of the Index shows economic freedom once again on the rise. Much of the momentum lost during the past five years has been regained. The global average economic freedom score in the 2014 Index is 60.3, the highest average in the 20-year history of the Index. The average is 0.7 point higher than last year and a 2.7 point improvement from 1995.
--In measuring economic freedom, the Index analyzes countries’ commitment to the rule of law, principles of limited government, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. Judged by these standards, the global economy as a whole has become “moderately free.” Scores improved in eight of the 10 economic freedoms, with investment freedom gaining an impressive 3.3 points on average. Labor freedom and government spending scores were higher by an average of about 1 point or more. Average scores declined only in the area of rule of law, with property rights and freedom from corruption losing 0.3 point each.
--114 countries, the majority of which are less developed, contributed to the growth in economic freedom over the past year; 43 countries, including Singapore, Sweden, Colombia, Poland, Cape Verde, and Turkey, achieved their highest economic freedom scores ever in the 2014 Index.
--While four countries recorded no score change, declines in economic freedom were registered in 59 countries, including nine advanced economies.
--The United States continues to lose ground to its competitors in the global race to advance economic freedom and prosperity. Registering a decline in economic freedom for the seventh year in a row, the U.S. tumbled from the ranks of the top 10 freest economies, falling two spots in the rankings to 12th place. The U.S. score has declined almost 6 points since 2007, placing the U.S. among those countries considered to be only “mostly free.” In the 2014 Index, the U.S. recorded notable declines in fiscal freedom, business freedom, and property rights.
--Average levels of economic freedom improved in all regions of the world except North America and the Middle East/North Africa. The AsiaCPacific region, led by Burma, Malaysia, and Samoa, showed the greatest gains, with an average increase exceeding 1 point. Sub-Saharan Africa did almost as well, with countries gaining 0.9 point on average. Europe and the South and Central America/Caribbean region recorded average score improvements of 0.5 point and 0.3 point, respectively.
--Despite the global progress over the past two decades, the number of people living in economically “unfree” countries remains very high: 4.5 billion, or about 65 percent of the world’s population. More than half of these people live in just two countries, China and India, where advancement toward greater economic freedom has been patchy at best.
--The 20 years of Index data attest unequivocally that economies achieving or sustaining higher levels of economic freedom measurably outperform others in achieving dynamic economic growth, long-term prosperity, and greater progress in many dimensions of social and human development.

Commemorating the 20 years of the Index, the 2014 edition features four notable chapters that show why, now more than ever, it is imperative that economic freedom be defended and advanced.
--Dr. Kim R. Holmes, a founding editor of the Index, looks back over its 20-year history and highlights key milestones of the Index in the context of its development, its impact, and the overall policy lessons that have been learned. His key finding: More than any other political or policy approach, economic freedom generates more opportunities and greater well-being for more people. The Index has clearly demonstrated the power of free-market, limited-government, rules-based capitalism to help people prosper.
--Anthony B. Kim analyzes long-term trends in the 20-year Index database and documents the measurable benefits of policies that improve economic freedom. For the past two decades, countries that have accepted the challenge of enhancing economic freedom have reaped great rewards and have set a powerful example for others to follow. Advancing economic freedom is the proven path to greater prosperity and progress.
--Dr. John Tomasi of Brown University develops a strong moral case for economic freedom, laying out both the institutional and the individual cases for economic freedom. Economic liberty must be defended not only because it has a proven record of securing political and material benefits, but also because it ensures that ordinary people can make their own choices and actions in pursuit of their dreams.
--Sergio Daga, Research Director of Populi, a Bolivian think tank, examines the effectiveness of government conditional cash transfer programs that have become the most common social assistance intervention by governments in many less developed economies. As Daga concludes, countries that embrace government-led money transfer programs would achieve better results in poverty reduction by removing barriers to economic freedom and reducing dependence on the state.

	<hr><br>
	
--Competition for the top spot in the Index rankings has intensified. Hong Kong maintained its status as the world’s freest economy, a remarkable distinction that it has achieved for 20 consecutive years. Singapore, the second-freest economy, has closed the gap between itself and Hong Kong to only 0.7 point, the second narrowest difference in Index history.
--Along with Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Canada are the only economies considered “free” with economic freedom scores above 80 on the 0-to-100 Index grading scale. Australia continues in third place, a position it has held since 2009, while Switzerland has overtaken New Zealand and is now in fourth place, its highest ranking ever. Canada remains the world’s sixth-freest economy for the fourth year in a row.
--Chile (seventh) and Mauritius (eighth), two small but reform-minded economies, are the highest-ranking developing countries in the Index. Their relative economic strength is no fluke. Both have demonstrated persistent commitment to the rule of law, limited government, regulatory efficiency, and open markets through good times and bad.
--Ireland (ninth) has moved up by two slots, overtaking the U.S., and Denmark, which moves down to 10th place.
--A notable realignment of European countries continues to be underway in terms of advancing economic freedom. Eighteen, including Germany, Sweden, Lithuania, Georgia, Austria, the Czech Republic, Norway, Macedonia, Latvia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania, recorded their highest economic freedom scores ever in the 2014 Index. By contrast, five others (Greece, Italy, France, Cyprus, and the United Kingdom) registered scores lower than those they first received nearly two decades ago when the Index began recording economic freedom.
--Progress among the so-called BRIC nations has stalled. Brazil plunged 14 places in the rankings to 114th and is now judged “mostly unfree” in the Index. The rankings of the other BRIC countries―Russia, India, and China―declined slightly to 140th, 120th, and 137th, respectively.
--Liberia and Sierra Leone, two post-conflict countries, have moved up and are no longer considered “repressed” economies. Notably, six of the 11 countries that recorded ranking improvements of 10 places or more are from the Sub-Saharan Africa region.

Ambassador Terry Miller and Anthony B. Kim

The 2014 Index of Economic Freedom, covering 186 countries in six regions, finds economic freedom advancing worldwide despite challenging economic and political environments. The global average economic freedom score has reached 60.3, the highest ever recorded in the 20-year history of the Index. World economic freedom has improved by 0.7 point from last year and 2.7 points from 1995. Much of the momentum toward greater freedom that had been lost during the past five years has been regained.

Of the 178 economies numerically graded in the 2014 Index, six have earned the designation of “free” with scores above 80. The next 28 countries, with scores between 70 and 80, are considered “mostly free.” These 34 economies sustain and provide institutional environments in which individuals and private enterprises enjoy a substantial degree of economic freedom in the pursuit of greater opportunity and prosperity.

The largest portion of the countries graded―117 economies―have freedom scores between 50 and 70. Of those, 56 economies are considered “moderately free” (scores of 60C70), and 61 are “mostly unfree” (scores of 50C60). Twenty-seven countries have “repressed” economies with scores below 50.

Despite the global progress over the past two decades, which occurred most dramatically in the 10 years from 1998 to 2007, the number of people living in economically “unfree” countries remains very high: 4.5 billion, or about 65 percent of the world’s population. The path to prosperity for these individuals is very difficult indeed. More than half of these people live in just two countries, China and India, where advancement toward greater economic freedom has been patchy at best.

The advancement of global economic freedom to its highest level in the 2014 Index is particularly welcome given that the notable upsurge has been driven by developing and emerging economies around the world.
--114 countries, the majority of which are less developed, contributed to the growth in economic freedom over the past year; 43 countries, including Singapore, Sweden, Colombia, Poland, Cape Verde, and Turkey, achieved their highest economic freedom scores ever in the 2014 Index. 
<a href= "pic01.html">ECONOMIC FREEDOM (Global) </a><br><br>
--Score improvements in 17 countries, 16 of which are less developed, were significant enough to merit upgrades in the countries’ economic freedom status in the Index. Notably, Colombia became a “mostly free” economy for the first time. Seven developing countries, including the Philippines and Zambia, have advanced into the ranks of the “moderately free,” and eight countries have moved out of the status of economically “repressed.”
--Declining economic freedom was reported in 59 countries, including nine advanced economies such as the United States, France, Spain, and Cyprus. Four countries recorded no score change.
--Progress among the so-called BRIC nations has stalled. Brazil plunged 14 places in the rankings to 114th and is now rated “mostly unfree” in the Index. The rankings of the other BRIC countries―Russia, India, and China―declined slightly to 140th, 120th, and 137th, respectively.
--Liberia and Sierra Leone, two post-conflict countries, have moved up and are no longer considered “repressed” economies. Notably, six of the 11 countries that recorded ranking improvements of 10 places or more are from the Sub-Saharan Africa region.
--Four emerging economies have achieved notable score gains over the past five years: Colombia, Poland, the United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia. With a five-year cumulative score increase of over five points, each of these countries has recorded five years of sustained growth in economic freedom, successfully navigating the global economic uncertainty and turning what could have been a setback into an opportunity to upgrade its economic system.
--By sharp contrast, the United States has been on the opposite path as the only country to have recorded a loss of economic freedom for seven straight years.

	<b><a name="T13">COMPOSITION OF THE WORLD’S TOP 10 FREEST ECONOMIES</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The top 10 freest economies make up a high-performing group that has demonstrated persistent commitment to the rule of law, limited government, regulatory efficiency, and open markets through good times and bad. The 2014 Index has recorded noticeable achievements and a few realignments within this highly ranked group.
-- Competition for the top spot in the Index rankings has intensified. Hong Kong maintained its status as the world’s freest economy, a remarkable distinction that it has achieved for 20 consecutive years. Singapore, the second freest economy, has closed the gap between itself and Hong Kong to only 0.7 point, the second narrowest difference in Index history.
--Australia, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Canada join Hong Kong and Singapore as the only economies considered “free” with economic freedom scores above 80 on the 0-to-100 Index grading scale. Australia took third place, a position it has held since 2009, while Switzerland has overtaken New Zealand and is now in fourth place, its highest ranking ever. Canada remains the world’s sixth freest economy for the fourth year in a row.
--Chile (seventh) and Mauritius (eighth), two small but reform-minded economies, are the highest ranking developing countries in the Index.
--In addition to Switzerland, two other European countries are listed in the top 10. Ireland recorded a small score improvement, ending a half-decade of declining economic freedom, and returned to the top 10 after a year’s absence. Denmark earned designation as the world’s 10th freest economy.
--With its economic freedom continuing to decline, the United States is no longer one of the world’s 10 freest economies Its score plummeted sharply to 75.5, the second lowest rating the country has ever recorded in the 20-year history of the Index. With score declines each year from 2008 until 2014, the U.S. has dropped to 12th place, tying its lowest ranking since the inception of the Index two decades ago. Now considered only a “mostly free” economy, the U.S. has earned the dubious distinction of having recorded one of the longest sustained declines in economic freedom, second only to Argentina, of any country in the history of the Index.

	<b><a name="T14">DETERIORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
In measuring economic freedom, the Index analyzes countries’ commitment to the rule of law, principles of limited government, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. Judged by these standards, the global economy as a whole has become “moderately free.” Scores improved in eight of the 10 economic freedoms as summarized in “The 10 Economic Freedoms: A Global Look” on the next page. Investment freedom has gained an impressive 3.3 points on average, while labor freedom and government spending scores were higher by an average of one point or more. Average scores declined only in the area of rule of law, with property rights and freedom from corruption losing 0.3 point each.

	<b><a name="T15">Why Economic Freedom Matters: Global Snapshots</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The Index results, when compared with data measuring economic and social conditions in countries around the world, provide strong evidence of the free-market system’s success in promoting prosperity, human development, and democratic governance. Key features of that system, including private property rights, openness, and flexibility, are virtually uncontested as desirable features of economic policy.

<a href= "pic02.html">10 Economic Freedoms </a><br><br>
<a href= "pic03.html">Economic Freedoms and Prosperity</a><br><br>
Improving Lives Around the Globe. There are clear relationships between economic freedom and numerous positive economic and social indicators, the most prominent being the strong relationship between the level of economic freedom and the level of prosperity in a given country.

Economies rated “free” or “mostly free” in the 2014 Index enjoy incomes that are more than three times higher than average incomes in all other countries and more than 10 times higher than the incomes of “repressed” economies. Economic freedom is key to enhancing overall well-being, taking into account other factors such as health, education, security, and political governance.

Greater economic freedom is strongly correlated with overall human development as measured by the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures life expectancy, literacy, education, and the standard of living in countries worldwide. The prosperity that flows from economic freedom results in greater access to education, reduced illiteracy, increased access to higher-quality health care and food supplies, and longer life expectancy. (See Chart 3.) 
<a href= "pic04.html">Economic Freedoms and Human development</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic05.html">Economic Freedoms and Democratic Governance</a><br><br>
Debate over the complex interplay between economic freedom and democracy or political freedom has been renewed and intensified over the past three years, particularly as the Middle East and North Africa region has undergone a challenging period, but the positive relationship between the two is undeniable. By empowering people to exercise greater control of their daily lives, economic freedom ultimately nurtures political reform as well by making it possible for individuals to gain the economic resources necessary to challenge entrenched interests or compete for political power, thereby encouraging the creation of more pluralistic societies (Chart 4).

Pursuit of greater economic freedom is thus an important stepping stone to democracy. It empowers the poor and builds the middle class. It is a philosophy that encourages entrepreneurship and disperses economic power and decision-making throughout an economy.

Promoting Innovation and Environmental Sustainability. Also notably, in countries around the world, economic freedom has been shown to increase countries’ capacity for innovation and to improve overall environmental performance as well. The positive link between economic freedom and higher levels of innovation ensures greater economic dynamism in coping with various developmental challenges, and the most remarkable improvements in clean energy use and energy efficiency over the past decades have occurred not as a result of government regulation, but rather because of advances in economic freedom and freer trade that have unleashed greater economic opportunity and generated a virtuous cycle of investment, innovation (including in greener technologies), and dynamic economic growth (Charts 5 and 6).

	<b><a name="T16">REGIONAL RESULTS</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Each of the six Index regions continues to be represented by at least one country that ranks among the top 20 freest economies in the 2014 Index. Half of the leading economies are from Europe, led by Switzerland and Ireland. Five of the top 20 performers are in the AsiaCPacific region, with Taiwan further advancing within the ranks of the economically “mostly free.” Canada and the U.S. represent North America among the top 20. The other regions are represented by one country each among the 20 freest economies: Chile (South and Central America/Caribbean); Mauritius (Sub-Saharan Africa); and Bahrain (Middle East and North Africa).

While these countries differ greatly in their histories, political systems, and economic profiles, they share key characteristics. These top-performing economies in the Index are not necessarily geographically large or richly blessed with natural resources. Many economies have managed to expand opportunities for their citizens by enhancing their economic dynamism and vitality with high levels of economic freedom.

While the global average score for the 2014 Index has advanced notably, progress has not been uniform across the regions. On average, economic freedom made no progress in North America and actually declined in the Middle East/North Africa region. In the other four regions, economic freedom advanced. The AsiaCPacific region achieved the largest score improvement, with countries gaining slightly over one point on average. Sub-Saharan Africa gained the second most economic freedom on average: 0.9 point. Europe and the South and Central America/Caribbean region also recorded average score improvements of 0.5 point and 0.3 point, respectively.

<a href= "pic08.html">Economic Freedoms and Environment</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic09.html">Per capita Income</a><br><br>
Average levels of economic freedom vary widely among the regions. North America and Europe continue to record the highest average economic freedom scores among the six regions: 74.1 and 67.1, respectively. Despite the ongoing economic and political turmoil in some countries in the Middle East and North Africa, the region as a whole still achieved an average economic freedom score above 60 due to high levels of economic freedom in Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Average economic freedom scores in the South and Central America/Caribbean region, the AsiaCPacific region, and Sub-Saharan Africa continue to be below 60.

Although levels of economic freedom vary across the regions, the strongly positive relationship between economic freedom and prosperity is apparent throughout the world: In every region, per capita incomes are much higher in countries that are economically free. (See Chart 7.)
<a href= "pic10.html">Economic Freedoms: variation</a><br><br>
NORTH AMERICA: AMERICA’S STARTLING DECLINE

North America’s three countries have been linked by a regional trade agreement, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), since 1994. Over the past 20 years, NAFTA has been a positive force, connecting more than 400 million people in an economic area with about one-third of the world’s total GDP. The region has long benefited from its openness to international trade and investment. Although it enjoys the highest degree of economic freedom among the six regions, it has undergone a notable reordering in recent years: While Canada has solidified its status as a “free” economy, the U.S. and Mexico are seemingly stuck in the “mostly free” and “moderately free” categories, respectively.


The overall economic policy direction of the United States in recent years has involved substantial growth in the size and scope of government, accelerating the erosion of economic freedom and contributing directly to America’s fall from the top 10 freest economies. Specific policies that have curtailed economic freedom in the U.S. have entailed intrusive and costly regulations in areas like finance, health care, and the environment. These have injected uncertainty into business decision-making that has slowed job creation and hiring and hurt economic recovery and growth. The absence of meaningful fiscal reform has weakened the government’s balance sheet and led to the explosive growth of government debt. The increasing cronyism that has accompanied the growth of government has undermined the rule of law, further eroding America’s economic freedom and bringing it down to its second lowest level in the 20-year history of the Index.

EUROPE: CHANGING OF THE GUARD

In Europe, long-established free-market institutions in many countries allow the region to score above the world averages in most categories of economic freedom. Taken as a whole, however, the region has been undergoing tumultuous and uncertain times epitomized by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis affecting the eurozone. Europe’s overall economic freedom rating remains undermined by weak scores in the management of public spending, reflecting the cost of expanding government services and transfer payments that plainly hinder both productivity growth and dynamic job creation. Stagnant growth has also exacerbated debt levels, leaving many European countries with no choice but to cut spending to reduce unsustainable fiscal deficits. 
<a href= "pic11.html">One year score</a><br><br>
Still, 10 of the world’s 20 freest countries, led by Switzerland, are in Europe. A notable realignment of European countries continues to be underway in terms of advancing economic freedom. Eighteen, including Germany, Sweden, Lithuania, Georgia, Austria, the Czech Republic, Norway, Macedonia, Latvia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania, recorded their highest economic freedom scores ever in the 2014 Index. By contrast, five others (Greece, Italy, France, Cyprus, and the United Kingdom) registered scores lower than those they first received nearly two decades ago when the Index began to record economic freedom.
<a href= "pic12.html">Economic Freedom in Europe</a><br><br>
Sweden is a particularly interesting case, rising to 20th place in the Index despite extraordinarily high levels of per capita government spending. Unlike the troubled welfare states of Greece, Italy, and Portugal, the Swedish economy boasts highly efficient regulatory and legal regimes in addition to a high level of transparency and low corruption. These institutional assets strongly sustain productivity growth and promote resilience. In the 2014 Index, Sweden has recorded its highest economic freedom score ever.

Three Baltic nations―Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania―continue to advance. All three countries have recorded consecutive years of score improvements, demonstrating high levels of economic resilience. Both Lithuania and Latvia have recorded their highest economic freedom scores ever in the 2014 Index.

South and Central America/Caribbean: Mixed Progress

The South and Central America/Caribbean region, which consists of 29 economies, is one of the world’s most diverse, economically as well as politically.

Progress toward greater economic freedom has been made in more than half of the countries in the region. Seventeen countries recorded gains in economic freedom, while 12 had declines. The countries in the South and Central America/Caribbean region perform better than the world averages in four of the 10 components of economic freedom, including fiscal freedom and investment freedom. Corruption and a lack of protection for property rights are the major problem areas, reflecting long-standing issues of poor governance and weak rule of law.
Chile has been rated consistently as one of the “mostly free” economies with economic freedom scores above 70. Achieving its highest economic freedom score ever in the 2014 Index, Colombia has become a “mostly free” economy for the first time. By sharp contrast, Cuba remains the least free economy in the region, and Argentina has plunged further to the ranks of the economically “mostly unfree.”

MIDDLE EAST/NORTH AFRICA: AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS

The Middle East/North Africa region, which consists of 18 countries, continues to undergo widespread turmoil, and many of its economies remain only “moderately free” or “mostly unfree.”

Structural and institutional problems abound, and the regional unemployment rate, which averages more than 10 percent, is among the highest in the world and is most pronounced among younger members of the labor force. The region’s troubles are complex, rooted in decades of authoritarianism that has kept power and resources monopolized in the hands of a few. The problems will not be solved simply by holding elections with more political parties or allowing freedom of expression. Hard institutional reforms that reduce the state’s role in the economy and in people’s lives are required. Leaders have already fallen, yet regimes and institutions remain and craftily guard their power.
Scores for most of the countries in the region are concentrated between 50 and 70. Saudi Arabia and Israel have recorded two of the largest score gains. Progress made in those two countries has been underpinned by efforts to strengthen the business climate, boost investment, and foster the emergence of a more vibrant private sector. The United Arab Emirates has advanced its economic freedom for five consecutive years. In the 2014 Index, the UAE has advanced steadily into the ranks of the “mostly free” economies, with progress due in large part to the government’s consistent commitment to economic reforms that have encouraged a dynamically evolving private sector.

Bahrain, ranked 13th globally with an economic freedom score of 75.1, is the only Middle Eastern country among the world’s 20 freest economies. It has been undertaking a challenging transition to greater openness and transparency, more visibly since early 2011. Enhancing the foundations of economic freedom through improvements in property rights and corruption will be critical to ensuring success.

Qatar continues as the other “mostly free” economy in the region. While very different politically, five “moderately free” economies, including Jordan, Israel, Oman, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, share a common commitment to economic freedom that is significantly greater than that of the remaining countries in the region.
ASIACPACIFIC: THE MOST IMPROVED REGION

The AsiaCPacific region contains over half of the world’s population: one-third in China and nearly another third in India.
The AsiaCPacific region is distinguished by the extraordinary disparity in levels of economic freedom among its economies. Four of the world’s 10 freest economies―Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand―are in this region, yet most of the other countries remain “mostly unfree.” Countries such as Turkmenistan and Burma have economies that are “repressed.” North Korea, which continues to reject any form of free-market activity, remains the least free economy in both the region and the world.

Leading the world in three of the 10 economic freedoms, Hong Kong once again is the freest economy overall in the 2014 Index. With the emergence of a more dynamic and competitive financial sector, Singapore continues to boost its productivity through its openness to global trade and investment and has maintained its hold on second place in the rankings, narrowing the gap slightly with Hong Kong. Australia and New Zealand continue to set the standard for clean, corruption-free government and benefit significantly from their transparent and efficient business environments and open-market policies.

India and China remain “mostly unfree.” These two countries’ high economic growth has not been deeply rooted in policies that promote economic freedom. The foundations for long-term economic development continue to be fragile in the absence of effectively functioning legal frameworks. Progress with market-oriented reforms has been uneven and has often backtracked at the urging of those with a political interest in maintaining the status quo.
Africa’s overall level of economic freedom is weaker than that of any other region. However, the 2014 Index has identified encouraging developments. No other region has made greater strides in economic freedom than Sub-Saharan Africa over the past two years. With an average score gain of 0.9 point that reflects a net gain of economic freedom in 20 countries, the Sub-Saharan Africa region is the second most improved region in the 2014 Index.

Following Mauritius, which continues to be one of the top 10 freest economies, Botswana remains the region’s second freest economy, followed by Cape Verde and Rwanda. Securing its status as one of the world’s “moderately free” economies, Cape Verde, a small island nation, has registered an impressive score gain of more than two points over the past year. Reforms in these countries have supported economic expansion and a gradual reduction in poverty. The positive economic results achieved through advancing economic freedom have created valuable momentum for additional institutional reforms that are needed to ensure long-term economic development. Regrettably, economic freedom in the region’s largest economy, South Africa, has declined over the past decade, dimming hopes for a more prosperous and stable future on the African continent’s southern tip.

Overall, Africa’s competitiveness has improved in specific areas, with many countries ensuring more sustainable fiscal policies, better-managed inflation, and more efficient markets. However, many African countries are low in the rankings: Of the 20 lowest-ranked economies, 13 are from Africa. Looking forward, African economies must continue to develop economic environments that are based on productivity enhancements. This means keeping a clear focus on strengthening the institutional, physical, and human capital prerequisites for a strong and competitive private sector.

	<b><a name="T17">THE INDEX AT 20: RENEWED: COMMITMENT TO ADVANCING FREEDOM</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
As documented in this chapter, every region includes positive examples of countries that have chosen freedom and reaped the rewards for their citizens. As shown in the Index over the past 20 years, economic freedom is the indispensable link between economic potential and prosperous outcomes. No other system comes close in terms of providing for broad-based economic growth and progress. Those who are looking for solutions rather than excuses will find in this Index the economic policies and concrete examples that can promote entrepreneurship and long-term economic growth irrespective of history, resources, or level of development.

A recurring theme of human history has been resilience and revival. As Friedrich A. Hayek once observed, “If old truths are to retain their hold on men’s minds, they must be restated in the language and concepts of successive generations.” As we celebrate the 20th edition of the Index of Economic Freedom, it is time to renew our commitment to measuring, explaining, and fostering economic freedom with even greater clarity and conviction so that new generations can understand and benefit from its proven principles.
